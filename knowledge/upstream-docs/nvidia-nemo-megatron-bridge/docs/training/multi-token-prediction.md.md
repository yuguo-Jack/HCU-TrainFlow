# Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)

## Overview

Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) is an advanced training technique introduced in the [DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437) that enables models to predict multiple future tokens simultaneously during pre-training. Instead of learning to predict only the next token at each position, MTP adds auxiliary prediction heads that predict tokens 2, 3, or more positions ahead.

### Key Benefits

- **Densified Training Signals**: Multiple learning signals per training iteration improve data efficiency
- **Pre-Planning Representations**: Models learn internal representations that encode information about future tokens
- **Speculative Decoding Foundation**: MTP-trained models can serve as foundation for faster inference via speculative decoding

### When to Use MTP

MTP is most beneficial for:

- **Large-scale pre-training** (models > 10B parameters)
- **Data-constrained scenarios** where maximizing learning from limited data is critical
- **Training foundation models** intended for downstream fine-tuning or speculative decoding

MTP is primarily used for pre-training.

## Configuration Parameters

MTP is controlled by two primary parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `mtp_num_layers` | int | `None` (disabled) | Number of auxiliary prediction depths. Each layer predicts tokens N positions ahead (N=1,2,...,mtp_num_layers). | 1-2 |
| `mtp_loss_scaling_factor` | float | `0.1` | Weight applied to MTP losses relative to main next-token loss. Controls the contribution of auxiliary predictions to the total loss. | 0.05-0.2 |

### Loss Calculation

The total training loss combines the main next-token prediction loss with averaged MTP losses:

```
total_loss = main_loss + (avg_mtp_loss * mtp_loss_scaling_factor)

where:
  avg_mtp_loss = mean([mtp_1_loss, mtp_2_loss, ..., mtp_N_loss])
```

### Parameter Tuning Guidelines

**`mtp_num_layers`:**
- Start with `1` for most models (predicts 1 token ahead)
- Use `2` for models > 100B parameters if memory allows
- Higher values increase memory usage and training time proportionally

**`mtp_loss_scaling_factor`:**
- Default `0.1` works well for most models
- Increase to `0.15-0.2` if MTP losses aren't decreasing
- Decrease to `0.05-0.08` if main loss is being overshadowed
- Scale factor should be proportional to `mtp_num_layers` (more layers → lower factor)

## Basic Usage: Training from Scratch

### Minimal Configuration Example

Here's a minimal example using the Qwen3 30B-A3B recipe with MTP enabled:

```python
from megatron.bridge.recipes.qwen.qwen3_moe import qwen3_30b_a3b_pretrain_config
from megatron.bridge.training.pretrain import pretrain
from megatron.bridge.training.gpt_step import forward_step
from megatron.bridge.training.config import ConfigContainer

log_dir = "/path/to/log/dir"
cfg: ConfigContainer = qwen3_30b_a3b_pretrain_config()
cfg.logger.tensorboard_dir = log_dir + "/tb_logs"
cfg.checkpoint.save = log_dir + "/checkpoints"
cfg.checkpoint.load = log_dir + "/checkpoints"
# Set up training dataset
cfg.dataset.blend=[[
    f"/path/to/dclm/preprocessed/dclm_{i:02d}_text_document"
    for i in range(1, 11)
], None]
cfg.dataset.split="9999,8,2"
cfg.dataset.path_to_cache = "/path/to/cache"
# cfg.model.num_layers = 8  # train a smaller model if OOM
# MTP Configuration
cfg.model.mtp_num_layers = 1
cfg.model.mtp_loss_scaling_factor = 0.1
pretrain(cfg, forward_step)
```
Follow the [DCLM Tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/tree/main/tutorials/data/dclm) to prepare the training data 


## MTP with Pipeline Parallelism

By default, Bridge recipes place MTP layers in the last pipeline stage alongside the loss computation layer. Recent Megatron Core versions also support placing all MTP layers in a standalone stage before the final loss stage by setting `pipeline_model_parallel_layout` with `m` entries.

### Pipeline Layout Guidelines

MTP layers take approximately the same training time as a regular transformer layer. When configuring your pipeline layout:

- Use `m` in `pipeline_model_parallel_layout` for MTP layers.
- Keep all MTP layers in the same PP/VPP stage.
- Place MTP after decoder layers and before the final loss stage.
- For standalone MTP, place an `m` stage on a non-final pipeline rank and put `L` in the final stage, for example `"E|t*3|(t|)*3tt|m|L"`.
- For colocated MTP, keep `m` with `L` in the last stage, for example `"E|t*3|(t|)*5mL"`.

DeepSeek-V3 recipes include a helper for the common layouts:

```python
from megatron.bridge.recipes.deepseek import (
    deepseek_v3_pretrain_config,
    set_deepseek_v3_pipeline_model_parallel_layout,
)

cfg = deepseek_v3_pretrain_config()
set_deepseek_v3_pipeline_model_parallel_layout(cfg.model, mtp_standalone=True)
```

## Parallelism Support

MTP is compatible with all major parallelism strategies in Megatron-Bridge:

| Parallelism Type | Support Status | Notes |
|------------------|----------------|-------|
| **Tensor Parallelism (TP)** | ✅ Fully Supported | MTP layers are automatically sharded across TP ranks |
| **Pipeline Parallelism (PP)** | ✅ Supported with Layout Constraint | MTP is colocated with loss by default, or can use a standalone `m` stage through `pipeline_model_parallel_layout` |
| **Expert Parallelism (EP)** | ✅ Fully Supported | Works with MoE models (DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral, etc.) |
| **Context Parallelism (CP)** | ✅ Fully Supported | MTP supports long-context training via CP |
| **Data Parallelism (DP)** | ✅ Fully Supported | Standard data parallelism works transparently |

## Monitoring MTP Training

### Per-Layer Loss Logging

During training, you'll see losses for each MTP depth logged separately:

```
iteration      100/  300000 | consumed samples:         3200 | elapsed time per iteration (ms): 3738.6 | learning rate: 6.000000E-05 | global batch size:    32 | lm loss: 7.968678E+00 | load_balancing_loss: 1.329517E+00 | mtp_1 loss: 7.925096E+00 | loss scale: 1.0 | grad norm: 1.040 | number of skipped iterations:   0 | number of nan iterations:   0 |
```

### Interpreting Loss Values

![MTP Loss Curves](../images/mtp_loss.png)

The figure above shows typical training curves for MTP-enabled training:
- **Left**: MTP auxiliary loss (`mtp_1 loss`) tracking the first additional token prediction
- **Right**: Main language model loss (`lm loss`) for standard next-token prediction

**Expected Patterns:**

- **MTP losses are higher than main loss**: Predicting tokens further in the future is inherently harder. In the example above, `mtp_1 loss` (~4.3) is higher than `lm loss` (~3.9) at 3500 iterations.

- **All losses decrease over training**: Both main and MTP losses should trend downward, as shown in the curves above.

- **Loss gap remains relatively stable**: The difference between main and MTP losses should not grow significantly over training.

**Red Flags:**

- **NaN values**: Indicates training instability (see Troubleshooting section)
- **Diverging losses**: If MTP losses increase while main loss decreases, reduce `mtp_loss_scaling_factor`
- **Widening gap**: If MTP losses fall behind by > 1.0, increase `mtp_loss_scaling_factor`

**MTP vs Non-MTP Comparison:**

![MTP Loss Comparison](../images/mtp_loss_comparison.png)

The figure above compares `lm loss` between MTP-enabled (blue) and non-MTP (red) training runs on Qwen3-30B-A3B. The curves do not differ significantly in the first few thousand iterations. Notably, the MTP-enabled run shows smoother behavior around iterations 1000 and 2300, where the non-MTP run exhibits more pronounced spikes.

### TensorBoard/WandB Visualization

MTP losses are automatically logged to TensorBoard and/or WandB. Look for:

- `lm loss` - Main next-token prediction loss
- `mtp_1 loss` - First auxiliary prediction loss
- `mtp_2 loss` - Second auxiliary prediction loss (if `mtp_num_layers=2`)

### Training Characteristics

- MTP adds computational overhead due to additional forward passes
- Memory usage increases proportionally to `mtp_num_layers`
- MTP is designed to improve data efficiency during pre-training

**Model Performance:**

- MTP provides additional training signals at each token position
- Can potentially improve downstream task performance
- MTP-trained models can be used for speculative decoding during inference

## Current Limitations

The following features are not yet supported with MTP:

| Feature | Status | Workaround |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **HuggingFace ↔ Megatron Checkpoint Conversion** | ⚠️ Model-specific | Conversion support varies by model; check model-specific documentation |
| **Sequence Packing (Fine-Tuning)** | ❌ Not supported | For pre-training, no issues. For fine-tuning, set `enable_offline_packing=False` and `offline_packing_specs=None` |
| **Cross-Attention** | ❌ Not supported | MTP only works with decoder-only models (GPT, Llama, etc.) |
| **Learned Absolute Position Embeddings** | ❌ Not supported | Use RoPE (rotary position embeddings) or no position embeddings |
| **Block-Based Activation Recomputation** | ❌ Not supported | Use `recompute_granularity="selective"` or `"uniform"` |

### Important Notes

**Checkpoint Conversion:**

HuggingFace ↔ Megatron checkpoint conversion with MTP is model-specific. Some models have conversion support planned, while others may not support MTP parameter mapping. Check the documentation for your specific model.

**Sequence Packing:**

MTP is incompatible with fine-tuning sequence packing (e.g., SFT with packed sequences). For pre-training, there are no sequence packing restrictions.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Error: Out of Memory (OOM)

MTP increases memory usage proportionally to `mtp_num_layers`. Try:
- Reduce `mtp_num_layers` to 1
- Enable activation recomputation: `recompute_granularity="selective"`
- Increase pipeline parallelism
- Reduce micro batch size

### Error: MTP Loss is NaN

Training instability. Try:
- Lower learning rate
- Enable gradient clipping: `clip_grad=1.0`
- Use BF16 instead of FP16
- Reduce `mtp_loss_scaling_factor` to 0.05

### Expected Log: `MTP layers not found on this PP rank`

This is normal. Only the rank selected by the pipeline layout builds MTP layers. With the default layout this is the last pipeline stage; with standalone MTP it is the stage containing `m`.
