# Packed Sequences

Packed sequences are a fine-tuning technique that reduces padding waste by
concatenating multiple examples into one pack while preserving sequence
boundaries for attention. In Megatron Bridge, this is primarily a supervised
fine-tuning and PEFT optimization rather than a general pretraining feature.

This page is the stable overview for what packed sequences are, when to use
them, and which constraints are durable. For operational setup, code anchors,
and verification commands, see [skills/nemo-mbridge-perf-sequence-packing/SKILL.md](../skills/nemo-mbridge-perf-sequence-packing/SKILL.md).

## What It Is

Fine-tuning datasets often contain examples with highly variable lengths. When
those examples are batched conventionally, many tokens in each batch are just
padding. Packed sequences reduce that waste by building longer packs from
multiple examples and carrying boundary metadata into the attention path.

In Bridge today, there are four distinct packing paths plus long-context
enablement through context parallelism:

| Path | Use case | Key config |
|---|---|---|
| Offline packed SFT | Text-only finetuning | `enable_offline_packing=True` plus `offline_packing_specs` |
| Runtime in-batch packing | GPT-SFT JSONL, Direct Hugging Face, and supported VLM finetuning | `enable_in_batch_packing=True` |
| Energon online packing | Qwen-VL data using the model-owned Energon collator | `packing_buffer_size=<candidate samples per worker>` |
| Global-batch online packing | Variable-length SFT, packed every step across data-parallel ranks | `enable_global_batch_packing=True` |
| Long-context (CP) | Pretrain / finetune at 16K-128K+ | `context_parallel_size > 1` |

These are related but they are not the same knob. The four packing paths
solve padding waste and differ in when, and over which samples, they form
packs; long-context training primarily addresses activation memory and communication tradeoffs at larger
sequence lengths.

The shared implementation lives under `megatron.bridge.data.packing`: offline
GPT SFT materialization, packed Parquet runtime datasets, bin-packing
algorithms, and collate-time THD packing each have separate modules. Energon
online packing uses the task encoder's native `select_samples_to_pack` and
`pack_selected_samples` API while reusing the same canonical THD batch builder. Global-batch
online packing keeps only its unpacked-sample contract there, because
Megatron-Core's scheduler forms its packs inside the training loop. Ordinary
non-packed padding remains in `megatron.bridge.data.collators`. Use
`scripts/training/prepare_gpt_sft_packed_data.py` when packed GPT SFT artifacts
should be prepared before launching training.

For `GPTSFTDatasetConfig`, in-batch packing works with both local mmap JSONL
schemas: prompt/completion (`GPTSFTDataset`) and chat
(`GPTSFTChatDataset`). Tokenization remains lazy: workers mmap the JSONL and
read, parse, and tokenize only the rows selected for the current logical
microbatch. Collation then concatenates those rows into one physical THD batch
row; it does not materialize an offline dataset or load the full source into
RAM. Use a microbatch-yielding `single` or `cyclic` dataloader; GPT-SFT
in-batch packing does not support the global-batch `batch` dataloader.

Local GPT-SFT data can also use `per_split_data_source_manifest_path` with MLM-style
alternating ratios and JSONL paths. Offline packing resolves the weighted raw
row stream first and writes one packed Parquet cache for the blended split.
The input JSONL files remain memory-mapped; blending does not concatenate them
into another raw file or load them all into host memory. A one-path split keeps
the established single-file behavior.

## When to Use It

Packed sequences are a good fit when all of the following are true:

- you are doing SFT, PEFT, or supported VLM finetuning using one of the three
  packing paths above
- your examples have variable lengths and padding waste is significant
- you can tolerate the micro-batch constraints of packed training

Packed sequences are usually not the right answer when:

- you are doing standard Megatron-style pretraining, which already concatenates
  documents during sampling
- you want long-context training in general, where context parallelism is often
  the main technique
- your model family or recipe explicitly opts out of packed-sequence support

## Choosing the Offline Pack Length

For text-only LLM SFT and PEFT, use 8192 as the first offline-pack target when
the model context limit, memory, and recipe support allow it. Compare candidate
lengths at the same token slots per optimizer step:

```text
token_slots_per_step = packed_sequence_size * global_batch_size
```

Thus 2K/GBS32, 4K/GBS16, and 8K/GBS8 each retain 65,536 token slots per step.
A longer pack can contain more source examples in the physical MBS1 row and
reduce gradient accumulation and launch overhead. It also consumes more
activation memory and can encounter fixed-width kernel constraints, so measure
the candidates rather than treating 8K as unconditional.

Offline packing requires MBS1. The selected GBS must be divisible by and no
smaller than data parallel size; an 8K/GBS8 run therefore requires DP no
larger than 8. Keep model, dataset, and packed sequence lengths equal, write
changed packing configurations to a fresh output root, and verify the resolved
post-setup configuration. Changing pack length can alter truncation and pack
membership even when token slots stay constant, so rerun loss and stability
checks before replacing existing verification evidence.

Derive the internal sequence alignment from the resolved topology for both SFT
and PEFT:

```text
cp_multiple = 2 * CP if CP > 1 else 1
sp_multiple = CP * TP if sequence parallelism is enabled and TP > 1 else 1
pad_seq_to_mult = lcm(cp_multiple, sp_multiple)
```

For example, TP1/CP1 with SP disabled uses 1, while TP4/CP1 with SP enabled
uses 4. The difference comes from execution topology, not from whether the
trainable set is full SFT or PEFT. Pin the derived value explicitly and rebuild
the packed output after changing topology because the alignment changes pack
membership.

Keep this internal alignment separate from fixed final pack width.
`pad_to_max_length=true` is needed when a dispatcher or kernel requires a
static width, such as a HybridEP combine kernel with a fixed token chunk, or
when using CUDA graphs. CUDA graphs additionally require
`pad_cu_seqlens=true` and packing metadata. Ordinary eager offline packing
does not universally require fixed-width padding.

## Choosing Runtime In-Batch Packing

Use GPT-SFT in-batch packing when retaining the original JSONL is preferable
to generating packed Parquet artifacts. Enable it directly on the dataset
config and use a logical micro-batch larger than one:

```text
dataset.enable_in_batch_packing=true
dataset.dataloader_type=single
train.micro_batch_size=4
```

The collator preserves each sample's prompt/completion or chat loss mask and
emits current MCore packed metadata (`cu_seqlens_q`, `cu_seqlens_kv`, and the
corresponding padded boundaries when CP/SP alignment is required). The model
sees one physical THD row. `enable_in_batch_packing` and
`enable_offline_packing` are mutually exclusive. The `batch` dataloader is not
supported for GPT-SFT in-batch packing; use `single` or `cyclic`.

## Stable Constraints

The durable constraints for packed sequences in Bridge are:

- offline packed SFT requires configured `micro_batch_size == 1`
- GPT-SFT/Direct-HF/VLM in-batch packing requires configured `micro_batch_size > 1`;
  collation flattens those input rows into one physical THD batch row
- GPT-SFT in-batch packing requires `dataloader_type="single"` or `"cyclic"`;
  the global-batch `"batch"` dataloader is not supported
- Energon online packing currently supports the eager Qwen-VL collator path,
  requires physical `micro_batch_size == 1`, the generic `vlm_step`, per-token loss, and
  `ddp.average_in_collective=False`
- standard eager `alltoall` expert parallelism has functional coverage for
  Qwen3.6-35B-A3B at TP1/PP1/EP8 with EP communication overlap disabled; this
  is not a performance claim; other EP dispatchers are accepted with fixed-width
  native packs but do not yet have equivalent runtime evidence; THD boundaries
  produce a padding mask that excludes fixed-width gaps from MoE auxiliary-loss,
  z-loss, and expert-bias statistics
- current MCore may still dispatch those padded positions; expert-capacity/token-
  dropping configurations do not yet have native-packing runtime coverage
- `packing_buffer_size` counts candidate samples independently in every Energon
  worker; it is not a byte cache or a packed-sequence length
- Energon native packing and collator-owned `enable_in_batch_packing=True` are
  mutually exclusive
- Energon native packing does not currently support CUDA graphs, Qwen3-VL
  DistTrain, or pipeline parallelism; MTP is supported via MCore's packed
  sequence boundary-aware token rolling; requested MoE expert-parallel
  communication overlap is disabled with a warning so training uses the
  non-overlapped path
- when context parallelism is used, sequence length must satisfy the standard
  CP divisibility constraints
- GPT-SFT and Direct-HF sequence length must also satisfy the LCM of the training and
  evaluation CP constraints and `CP * TP` when sequence parallelism is enabled
- for fine-tuning with CP enabled, per-token loss behavior and reduction
  settings matter
- combined recipes using offline, in-batch, or Energon native packing
  automatically enable safe uneven-input padding for eager HybridEP; unpacked
  BSHD recipes preserve their configured setting
- the THD safety path pads only to the group-wide aligned maximum before
  dispatch and trims the padding after combine
- CUDA-graph-friendly packed metadata requires additional padding constraints

Model-family support is not universal. Some families and recipe paths explicitly
opt out of packed sequences or related packing modes.

HybridEP CUDA-graph configs preserve their explicit uneven-input setting because
the safety path performs a host scalar synchronization that is not capture-safe.
They must provide equal per-rank dispatch shapes. Disable CUDA graphs when packed
THD token counts can differ so the recipe can enable safe padding. Direct model-
provider callers must explicitly enable the setting when they supply uneven THD
inputs because no combined recipe is available to infer their layout.

## Global-Batch Online Packing

Global-batch online packing forms packs **once per training step, after a
data-parallel all-gather of sample lengths**, using Megatron-Core's
sequence-packing scheduler. Its candidate pool is the whole global batch across
data-parallel ranks. It is the only packing path whose pool crosses rank
boundaries, so it can even out packed work across ranks instead of packing each
rank's samples on their own.

| Path | Switch | Packs formed | Candidate pool |
|---|---|---|---|
| Offline packed SFT | `enable_offline_packing` plus `offline_packing_specs` | ahead of time, on disk | whole dataset |
| Runtime in-batch packing | `enable_in_batch_packing` | at collate time | one microbatch on one rank |
| Energon online packing | `packing_buffer_size` | in the dataloader buffer | one worker's buffer on one rank |
| Global-batch online packing | `enable_global_batch_packing` | every step, after a DP all-gather | the global batch across DP ranks |

### How It Works

Every step, Megatron-Core pulls the step's samples on each data-parallel rank,
all-gathers their lengths, and uses the `dp_balanced` scheduler to form packs of
at most `model.max_seqlen_per_dp_cp_rank x context_parallel_size` tokens. Each
pack becomes one THD microbatch with concatenated tokens, `cu_seqlens`
boundaries, per-sequence position ids, and variable-length attention, and it
runs on the model's context-parallel group. The number of microbatches
therefore changes from step to step, and Bridge passes the scheduled count to
the pipeline schedule.

Bridge wires the scheduler in through the same points the other packing paths
use:

- `dataset.enable_global_batch_packing` drives `model.sequence_packing_scheduler`,
  which defaults to `dp_balanced`.
- The mode counts as THD input, so MoE token dispatch gets the same safe-padding
  treatment as the other packing paths.
- It shares the runtime THD constraints listed below with Energon online packing.
- The context-parallel alignment multiple comes from the same derivation the
  other packing paths use.
- It marks the model for variable-length pipeline shapes.

`train_step` and `evaluate` wrap the raw data iterator once per step with
Megatron-Core's `wrap_data_iterator` and run the scheduled number of
microbatches. `get_batch` delegates to Megatron-Core's packed batch fetch, which
returns a finished `PackedSeqParams`. The scheduler's exact per-step token
statistics feed the FLOPs accounting, and the logged MoE and MTP auxiliary
losses are averaged over the microbatches that actually ran. The code lives in
`megatron.bridge.data.packing.global_batch` for the sample contract and
`megatron.bridge.training.global_batch_packing` for the training-loop glue.

### Datasets That Yield Unpacked Samples

The scheduler consumes **unpacked** per-sample dictionaries, one sample per
`micro_batch_size = 1` microbatch, delivered as a list rather than stacked into a
batch. Each sample carries `tokens`, `labels`, and `position_ids` as
`int64 [L]`, `loss_mask` as `float32 [L]`, and `original_seq_len` and
`padded_seq_len` as `int32 [1]`. Every `padded_seq_len` is a multiple of the
context-parallel alignment, which is `2 x context_parallel_size`, times the
tensor-parallel size under sequence parallelism.

Global-batch packing is available for SFT through
`GPTSFTDatasetConfig(enable_global_batch_packing=True)`. Its per-sample collate
shifts labels, builds the loss mask, and pads each sequence to the alignment
multiple. Use a `single` or `cyclic` dataloader. Dataset configs declare the
capability through `yields_unpacked_samples`, which validation checks.

### Configuration

```python
from megatron.bridge.recipes.utils.dataset_utils import default_coderforge_config

cfg.dataset = default_coderforge_config(seq_length=16384)
cfg.dataset.enable_global_batch_packing = True
cfg.dataset.dataloader_type = "single"
cfg.model.context_parallel_size = 2
cfg.model.max_seqlen_per_dp_cp_rank = 8192  # tokens per rank in one packed microbatch
cfg.model.calculate_per_token_loss = True
cfg.ddp.average_in_collective = False
cfg.train.micro_batch_size = 1
```

`ConfigContainer.validate` enforces the runtime THD constraints shared with
Energon online packing: micro batch size 1, per-token loss with
`average_in_collective=False`, no CUDA graphs, and no pipeline parallelism. It
also requires:

- a `single` or `cyclic` dataloader;
- an explicit `model.max_seqlen_per_dp_cp_rank` whose product with
  `context_parallel_size` covers the longest sample;
- no virtual pipeline parallelism, Mamba hybrid models, or Megatron FSDP;
- no other packing path on the same dataset;
- a dataset config that declares `yields_unpacked_samples`.

Validation also checks that the pinned Megatron-Core registers the requested
scheduler, and reports what is missing before training starts.

### When It Helps

Balancing across ranks matters when there is more than one data-parallel rank.
Per-rank packing can hand one rank several long samples while another gets short
ones, and the lighter ranks then wait at the gradient all-reduce. The scheduler
sees every rank's samples, so it can spread that work. With a single
data-parallel rank there is nothing to balance, and the mode reduces to per-step
packing of the local samples.

Evaluation uses the same scheduler, so each validation pass pulls a fixed number
of samples inside collective calls. The loader therefore checks up front that
the validation set holds enough samples for every evaluation in the run.

## Relationship to Long-Sequence Training

Packed sequences and long-sequence training are often mentioned together because
both affect sequence layout and memory behavior, but they solve different
problems:

- packed sequences mainly reduce padding waste in fine-tuning datasets
- long-sequence training mainly addresses activation memory and communication
  tradeoffs at larger sequence lengths

For long-sequence training guidance, see:

- `docs/performance-guide.md`
- `docs/training/hierarchical-context-parallel.md`

## Practical Caveats

The most stable caveats to remember are:

1. Packed-sequence support is recipe- and model-family-specific.
2. Fine-tuning sequence packing should not be assumed to work with every other
   training feature.
3. Setting a distinct evaluation CP only reserves compatible data shapes;
   activating it requires decentralized process groups and caller-managed eval
   groups. The eval-CP example demonstrates topology plumbing, not a complete
   real-data recipe; validation sharding and batch math must use the eval DP.
4. Packed sequences improve efficiency primarily by reducing padding waste, not
   by replacing long-context parallelism or memory-planning techniques.
5. An Energon checkpoint restores the loader's buffered samples and selected
   pack groups, but exact resumption still requires the same dataset, processor,
   topology, sequence length, and packing-buffer configuration.
6. `progress.txt` `Tokens` and the `time/tokens` runtime metric currently report
   configured token capacity (`consumed_train_samples * model.seq_length`), not
   exact packed-token utilization. Finite partial Energon packs can therefore
   make those values larger than the physical token slots executed, and neither
   metric excludes alignment padding to represent useful source tokens.
