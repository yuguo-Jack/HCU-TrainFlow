# MoE Training Optimization

This page covers the optimization framework, techniques, and best practices for
training Mixture-of-Experts models with Megatron-Core. It is based on
[Scalable Training of MoE Models with Megatron Core](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.07685).

## The Three Walls

MoE training is constrained by three tightly coupled barriers:

| Wall | Root Cause | Metric |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | All E experts stored but only K active per token | GB per GPU |
| **Communication** | EP all-to-all dispatches tokens across GPUs | % of step time |
| **Compute Efficiency** | Small expert GEMMs + host overhead | GPU SM utilization |

These walls interact: solving one often exposes another. FP8 reduces memory and
can improve GEMM throughput, but it can also shift more of the remaining cost
to quantization kernels and host overhead. Communication overlap can hide
latency, but it may add scheduling and buffer constraints. Effective
optimization treats all three as a unified system.

## The Optimization Workflow

Use the full evidence-gated loop:

```text
freeze the measurement contract -> fit -> scale -> profile -> retune -> validate
```

### Phase 0: Freeze the Measurement Contract

Before tuning, record and hold fixed the software/runtime versions, hardware
and topology, model/task/data/routing semantics, precision, sequence and batch
shape, parallelism, graph scopes, and steady-state timing window. Label forced
routing, synthetic data, or disabled optimizer/checkpoint paths as
**benchmark-only**; they cannot establish training-equivalent acceptance.

### Phase 1: Establish Memory-Feasible Parallelism

Memory is the hard gate — if it doesn't fit, nothing runs.

| Strategy | Activation | Weight | Optimizer | Comm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TP | 1/d (with SP) | 1/d | 1/d | High |
| EP | ~1 (load-dependent) | 1/d (MoE only) | 1/d | Medium |
| PP | 1 (>1 with VPP) | 1/d | 1/d | Medium |
| CP | 1/d | 1 | 1/d† | Medium |
| DP | 1 | 1 | 1/d† | Low |

†Requires `--use-distributed-optimizer`.

Quick test: use `--fake-init-process-group` to emulate distributed training on a
single GPU for rapid parallelism iteration before spending cluster time.

### Phase 2: Select Optimal Parallelism

Five guidelines, in order of priority:

1. **Minimize model parallelism, maximize DP.** Model parallelism adds
   communication; use distributed optimizer to free memory for larger DP.

2. **Keep EP × TP within the fast interconnect domain.** EP and TP are
   communication-intensive, so keeping the hot path on the fastest available
   links usually matters more than theoretical FLOPs.

3. **Use PP for multi-node scaling.** PP's point-to-point comms scale
   better across nodes than TP/EP. Enable VPP to reduce bubbles.

4. **Prefer EP over TP for expert layers.** EP gives better GEMM
   efficiency, lower communication, and eliminates local permutation
   when EP = num_experts. Use Parallel Folding to decouple attention TP
   from expert EP.

5. **Enable CP once sequence length makes attention memory dominant.** In
   practice that often starts around the 8K-class regime, but the exact point
   depends on model size and hardware. Use hierarchical CP (`a2a+p2p`) on
   NVL72-class systems when appropriate.

### Phase 3: Profile the Bottleneck

Profile the training run and operationally split the paper's compute-efficiency
wall into compute and host/launch bottlenecks:

**Memory bottleneck** — forced into full recompute or excessive parallelism:

| Optimization | Overhead | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| FP8 training | Low | `--fp8-format --fp8-recipe` |
| Selective recompute | Low | `--recompute-granularity --recompute-modules` |
| Precision-aware optimizer | Low | `--use-precision-aware-optimizer` |
| Activation offloading | Medium | `--fine-grained-activation-offloading` |
| Optimizer offloading | Medium | `--offload-optimizer-states` |

**Communication bottleneck** — profiling shows time in collectives:

| Comm Type | Fix |
|---|---|
| DP grad/param | `--overlap-grad-reduce --overlap-param-gather` |
| TP | `--tp-comm-overlap` |
| EP dispatcher | `--moe-token-dispatcher-type flex --moe-flex-dispatcher-backend {deepep\|hybridep}` |
| EP all-to-all | `--overlap-moe-expert-parallel-comm` |
| PP send/recv | `--pipeline-model-parallel-layout` (flexible VPP) |

**CPU overhead** — gaps between GPU kernels in Nsight traces:

| Fix | Flag |
|---|---|
| Disable Python GC | `--manual-gc --manual-gc-interval 10` |
| CUDA Graphs | `--cuda-graph-impl transformer_engine` |
| Reduce kernel launches | Decrease TP or increase MBS |

**Compute inefficiency** — low SM utilization despite no comm/CPU issues:

| Fix | Flag |
|---|---|
| Grouped GEMM | `--moe-grouped-gemm` |
| Kernel fusions | `--moe-router-fusion --moe-permute-fusion` |
| FP8 precision | `--fp8-format --fp8-recipe` |

### Phase 4: Retune One Variable at a Time

Use the profile to choose one candidate: dispatcher, one overlap mode, lower
precision, CUDA graphs, recompute, or a parallelism adjustment. Keep the rest
of the measurement contract fixed. Hardware support narrows the candidate set;
it does not guarantee which backend or precision mode will improve end-to-end
step time.

### Phase 5: Validate the Complete Winner

Use short post-warmup screens to reject weak candidates, then run the winner for
at least 50 steps and report a declared steady window. Require runtime evidence
that the requested dispatcher, lower-precision kernels, overlap path, and graph
replay actually ran. Report finite loss, skipped/NaN iterations, peak memory,
step time, model TFLOPS/GPU, and checkpoint/optimizer-state behavior when the
production path requires them.

This process is **iterative**: solving one bottleneck often exposes another.

## Parallel Folding

Attention and MoE layers have conflicting optimal parallelisms.
Parallel Folding decouples their configurations.

```text
Attention layers: TP × CP × DP × PP
MoE layers:      ETP × EP × EDP × PP  (PP must match)
```

Key benefits:
- **Breaks EP ≤ DP constraint**: EP can "fold" across TP×CP groups
- **Independent optimization**: Attention uses high TP; MoE uses ETP=1
- **Fewer GPUs needed**: CP=8 and EP=8 share the same 8 GPUs
- **NVLink-local comms**: Both CP and EP stay in high-bandwidth domain

Example: 256 GPUs with attention TP=4, CP=2, DP=8, PP=4.
Traditional: EP ≤ DP = 8. With folding: EP=64, ETP=1, EDP=1.

## Memory Optimization Stack

Ordered by overhead (lowest first):

1. **Memory-efficient permutation** (zero overhead): Absorbs routing
   weights into activations before FC2, eliminating saved tensors for
   router backward.

   Standard: `y = Σ p_i · W2_i · φ(W1_i · x)`
   Memory-efficient: `y = Σ W2_i · (p_i · φ(W1_i · x))`

   Mathematically equivalent when experts have no bias. Eliminates saving
   each expert output for router backward — activation is recomputed from
   already-saved inputs.

2. **FP8/FP4 activations**: Store linear-layer inputs in lower precision than
   BF16. This usually gives a modest but useful activation-memory reduction.

3. **Fine-grained recompute**: Recompute only cheap operations such as
   LayerNorm, activation functions, or model-specific up-projection modules.
   This often recovers much of the needed memory while keeping overhead much
   lower than full-layer recompute.

4. **Fine-grained offloading**: Module-level D2H/H2D with stream overlap. This
   can free a meaningful amount of memory at a small throughput cost and may
   allow a better parallelism layout that more than repays the offload overhead.

5. **Optimizer state offloading**: Move optimizer states to CPU between steps.
   This is especially attractive on GB200-class systems, where the host-device
   path is strong enough to make the trade practical.

6. **FSDP for MoE**: Dual DeviceMesh — primary mesh for attention,
   expert mesh for MoE. AllGather/ReduceScatter stay within small
   EDP groups. Zero-copy comms via NCCL User Buffer Registration.

## FP8 Recipe Selection

| Recipe | Platform | Granularity | Role after BF16 is stable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-tensor FP8 | Hopper/Blackwell | 1 scale/tensor | Starting point |
| Blockwise FP8 | Hopper | 128×128 blocks | Candidate when the target stack supports the intended kernels |
| MXFP8 | Blackwell | 1×32 elements | High-priority candidate |
| NVFP4 | Blackwell | 16 elements, 2-level | Speed-first candidate after BF16/FP8 validation |

Key rules:
- Router stays in FP32 always
- Embeddings, output layer, gradients, optimizer stay in original precision
- Expert GEMMs are the primary quantization target
- MXFP8 on Blackwell communicates params in BF16 (can't save on AllGather)
- NVFP4 requires Random Hadamard Transforms, 2D scaling, stochastic rounding

## CUDA Graphs for MoE

Two modes, different trade-offs:

| Mode | What's Captured | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Full CUDA Graphs | Entire fwd+bwd | Drop-and-pad MoE only |
| Partial (layer-wise) | router + moe_preprocess, optionally attn | Dropless-MoE candidate when host/launch overhead is visible |

Partial CUDA graphs capture static components while leaving dynamic expert
computation outside the graph. Start with the narrowest useful scope only after
profiling host/launch overhead. Validate replay against eager on the same full
stack: TE-scoped capture can be neutral or slightly slower when the workload is
not launch-bound, and an earlier win can disappear after dispatcher, overlap,
precision, or recompute changes.

For full CUDA Graphs on dropless MoE, three techniques are needed:

- **Device-initiated Grouped GEMM**: Reads shapes from GPU memory.
  cuBLASLt (CUDA 13.1+) or cuteDSL with fused activation/quantization.

- **ECHO** (Elastic Cloning for Hot Experts): Clones hot experts to
  underutilized ranks via bin-packing. Reduces load variance so
  worst-case buffer sizing is closer to actual.

- **Paged Stashing**: Single worst-case tmp buffer shared across layers
  for computation; paged stashing buffer stores only actual tokens.
  Reduces memory from O(layers × worst_case) to O(worst_case + actual).
  64 tokens per page, free list via circular buffer.

## Flexible Asymmetric VPP

PP layout string controls per-stage layer distribution:

```bash
--pipeline-model-parallel-layout "Et*3|(tt|)*29m|L"
```

- `E` = embedding, `t` = transformer, `m` = MTP, `L` = loss, `|` = stage boundary
- Balance workload: embedding + N dense layers ≈ fewer MoE layers
- Place MTP and loss on dedicated stages for memory isolation

## EP Communication Overlap

For exact overlap constraints and verification guidance, see
[docs/training/communication-overlap.md](communication-overlap.md) and the
related MoE overlap skills.

Two overlap patterns for 1F1B:

1. **Merged FWD-FWD / BWD-BWD**: Same-type passes from two microbatches
   run in parallel. Costs 2× activation memory. Less overlap (fwd compute
   is half of bwd).

2. **Merged FWD-BWD** (preferred): Forward of microbatch i+1 overlaps
   with backward of microbatch i. No extra memory. Matches DualPipe
   design. Limited: first FWD and last BWD can't be hidden.

Key optimization: **W/D split**. Split backward MLP work into weight-gradient
and data-gradient pieces so the weight-gradient portion can overlap with forward
compute when forward MLP alone is too short to hide dispatch cost.

## MoE Token Dispatchers

MoE models route tokens to experts via all-to-all communication. The
dispatcher backend controls how this communication is implemented:

| Dispatcher | Backend | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `alltoall` | Standard MoE | Torch-native all-to-all collectives |
| `flex` + DeepEP | DeepEP library | Low-latency SM-based dispatch with GPU-side routing |
| `flex` + HybridEP | HybridEP library | Fused intra-node NVLink + inter-node IB dispatch |

### Explicit backend selection

Recipes and `apply_flex_dispatcher_backend` preserve the requested backend,
independently of the GPU on the machine constructing the configuration.
Hardware validation runs on the training GPU after recipe inheritance and
user overrides. An unsupported backend raises an error; it is not automatically
replaced with `alltoall`. Unknown backend names and a final `flex` configuration
without a backend also raise errors.

For example, a DeepEP recipe used on GB200 must explicitly select a supported
backend such as HybridEP, or select standard dispatch:

```python
cfg.model.moe_token_dispatcher_type = "alltoall"
cfg.model.moe_flex_dispatcher_backend = None
```

`apply_flex_dispatcher_backend(cfg.model, None)` explicitly sets this pair too.
The performance launcher's `--moe_flex_dispatcher_backend None` option continues
to disable flex dispatch. Its backend-only Hydra override
`model.moe_flex_dispatcher_backend=null` is also normalized to `alltoall` during
launcher finalization. Direct API users must configure both fields or use the
helper; validation itself does not repair inconsistent configurations.

Older user configs and copied recipes that relied on automatic hardware
fallback need the same explicit selection. For a generic H100 recipe used on
GB200/GB300, select a recipe for the target hardware or set the desired backend
before training. Backend package and topology requirements still apply.

### Hardware-informed candidate order

| Hardware | Bring-up | Tuned candidates |
|---|---|---|
| H100 / B200 (NVL8) | `alltoall` | A/B DeepEP and HybridEP when supported |
| GB200 / GB300 (NVL72) | `alltoall` | HybridEP first, then compare other installed backends |

Topology and EP degree affect the candidate order, but they do not determine the
winner. The canonical 16×H100 Qwen3 30B recipe uses HybridEP, while the current
256×H100 Qwen3 235B recipe uses standard `alltoall` plus overlap.

Treat dispatcher package availability as part of the experiment setup, not as a
given. `alltoall` is the correctness fallback and should be the first smoke test
on a new container. DeepEP and HybridEP require their corresponding runtime
packages to be installed; otherwise the config can select
`moe_token_dispatcher_type="flex"` and still fail during model construction.
Keep the container, CUDA graph scope, routing mode, and MoE kernel-fusion flags
fixed when comparing dispatcher throughput.

### Short-run H100 sanity check

The current canonical 16×H100 Qwen3 30B-A3B BF16 performance recipe uses
HybridEP with 32 SMs, 64-token combine chunks, plain EP overlap, delayed
weight-gradient compute disabled, and TE graphs over `moe_router` and
`moe_preprocess`. Its verified 50-step run averaged 20.14729 seconds and
299.352 model TFLOPS/GPU over steps 41–50. This is a workload-specific result,
not a universal H100 dispatcher rule.

On 2026-05-17, a 16-GPU H100 smoke run of Qwen3 30B A3B BF16 with EP=16 and
the recipe's Transformer Engine CUDA graph scopes (`moe_router`,
`moe_preprocess`) completed with `alltoall` after disabling
`moe_permute_fusion` for a Triton JIT compatibility issue in the container.
The five-step run had a 45.65 s mean step time after the first warmup step,
132.9 mean TFLOP/s/GPU after warmup, final loss 11.44050, and 61.351 GB peak
max allocated memory. In the same container, DeepEP and HybridEP selected the
requested flex backend in the dumped config but failed before iteration 1
because the DeepEP/HybridEP packages were not installed. Use this as an
availability caveat, not as evidence that `alltoall` is faster than flex
dispatchers on H100.

## Long-Context MoE Training

At long sequences (64K+), SDPA dominates FLOPs. Context parallelism (CP)
is the primary mechanism for scaling sequence length.

CP sizing rules of thumb:

1. **Start with CP ≈ seq_len / 4096**: then round to a practical layout.

2. **Keep DP ≥ 1**: CP × EP × TP × PP must not exceed total GPUs.

3. **Prefer selective recompute over full**: Recompute `up_proj, norm, moe,
   mlp` rather than full recompute for better throughput.

4. **TP can sometimes substitute for some CP on NVLink systems**: on NVL72
   systems, higher TP can be competitive with a more CP-heavy plan.

5. **Optimizer CPU offload is often critical** at long context because
   activation pressure consumes so much of the memory budget.

Long-context recommendations:
- Keep sub-sequence length ~4096–8192 per CP/TP shard
- **Don't recompute SDPA at long context**: SDPA recompute adds significant
  compute overhead while saving relatively little memory. Recompute
  non-SDPA modules instead.
- TP preferred within node (fast comms, reduces param memory)
- P2P CP preferred across nodes (natural overlap with attention)
- a2a CP + TP within node when ring exchange is undesirable

## Dynamic Context Parallelism

For variable-length training (RL, SFT):
- Per-microbatch CP sizing instead of static CP for all
- Pre-constructs multiple CP groups during init (powers of 2)
- Scheduler selects effective cp_size per microbatch
- Works with packed sequences (THD format)

## MoE VLM Training

MoE vision-language models combine a vision encoder with a MoE language
decoder. Training requires choosing between two strategies:

| Approach | Mechanism | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| FSDP | Shards params, grads, and optimizer across all GPUs | Simpler setup and a better first bring-up path |
| 3D Parallel | TP + PP + EP + DP | Higher throughput ceiling once the multimodal path is already stable |

Key principles:
- **Always benchmark with real vision data** — image-free mock runs can
  significantly overestimate throughput.
- **Freezing vision encoder** saves compute when fine-tuning only the decoder.
- **MBS is critical for 3D-parallel VLM** — larger micro-batch sizes often
  matter more than they do for text-only MoE.
- **FSDP is simpler and often competitive** for initial bring-up.
