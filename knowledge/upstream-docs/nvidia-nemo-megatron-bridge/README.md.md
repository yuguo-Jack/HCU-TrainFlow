## Overview

NeMo Megatron Bridge is a PyTorch-native library within the [NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo) that provides pretraining, SFT and LoRA for popular language, vision-language, audio, and multimodal models. It serves as a powerful **bridge, conversion, and verification layer** between 🤗 Hugging Face and [Megatron Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core). It provides bidirectional checkpoint conversion between these formats, enabling other projects to leverage Megatron Core's parallelism capabilities or export models for various inference engines. The bridge includes built-in verification mechanisms to ensure conversion accuracy and checkpoint integrity across different model formats.

On top of the bridge, NeMo Megatron Bridge provides a performant and scalable PyTorch-native training loop that leverages [Megatron Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) to deliver state-of-the-art training throughput. It supports pretraining and fine-tuning with features like tensor and pipeline parallelism, and mixed precision (FP8, BF16, FP4, etc.). Users can either use existing 🤗 Hugging Face models or define custom PyTorch model definitions for flexible end-to-end workflows.

NeMo Megatron Bridge is a refactor of the [previous NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) training stack that adopts a PyTorch-native training loop to provide greater flexibility and customizability for developers.

## 🔧 Installation

### 🐳 NeMo Framework container

The best experience, highest performance, and full feature support are provided by the [NeMo Framework container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo/tags). Fetch the most recent $TAG and run the following to start a container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -w /workdir -v $(pwd):/workdir \
  --entrypoint bash \
  --gpus all \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:${TAG}
```

For development installation and additional details, please refer to our [Contribution guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Megatron-Core Submodule (main & dev)

Megatron Bridge pins [Megatron-Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) as a git submodule at `3rdparty/Megatron-LM`. The repository tracks two pinned commits — one from the upstream **main** branch (default) and one from **dev** — managed by `scripts/switch_mcore.sh`.

The submodule committed to the repo always points to the **main** commit. Use the **dev** commit when you need a Megatron-Core feature or fix that has not yet landed on main, or to validate forward-compatibility with upcoming MCore changes:

```bash
./scripts/switch_mcore.sh status   # Show current commit
./scripts/switch_mcore.sh dev      # Switch to dev; then run: uv sync
./scripts/switch_mcore.sh main     # Switch back; then run: uv sync --locked
```

> **Note:** `uv.lock` is generated against the main commit. After switching to dev, use `uv sync` (without `--locked`). After switching back to main, use `uv sync --locked`.

The dev branch follows Megatron-LM's upstream [dev branch philosophy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/dev) — features are experimental, follow a streamlined review process, and must graduate to stable within 6 months or be deprecated.

## ⚡ Quickstart

To get started, install Megatron Bridge or download a NeMo Framework container as described [above](#-installation).

Log in to Hugging Face Hub:

```sh
huggingface-cli login --token <your token>
```

Conversion-only quickstart (✅ Core):

```python
from megatron.bridge import AutoBridge

# 1) Create a bridge from a Hugging Face model (hub or local path)
bridge = AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B", trust_remote_code=True)

# 2) Get a Megatron provider and configure parallelism before instantiation
provider = bridge.to_megatron_provider()
provider.tensor_model_parallel_size = 1
provider.pipeline_model_parallel_size = 1
provider.finalize()
# 3) Materialize Megatron Core model(s)
model = provider.provide_distributed_model(wrap_with_ddp=False)

# 4a) Export Megatron → Hugging Face (full HF folder with config/tokenizer/weights)
bridge.save_hf_pretrained(model, "./hf_exports/llama32_1b")

# 4b) Or stream only weights (Megatron → HF)
for name, weight in bridge.export_hf_weights(model, cpu=True):
    print(name, tuple(weight.shape))
```

Training quickstart using pre-configured recipes:

```python
from megatron.bridge import AutoBridge
from megatron.bridge.recipes.llama.h100 import llama32_1b_pretrain_1gpu_h100_bf16_config
from megatron.bridge.training.gpt_step import forward_step
from megatron.bridge.training.pretrain import pretrain

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The recipe uses the Llama 3.2 1B architecture from Hugging Face.
    # This is random-init pretraining and does not require a converted Megatron checkpoint.
    cfg = llama32_1b_pretrain_1gpu_h100_bf16_config()

    # The recipe already sets cfg.model internally using this pattern.
    # Override cfg.model to choose a different Hugging Face model ID as the architecture source.
    # cfg.model = AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B").to_megatron_provider(load_weights=False)

    # Optional: use a local Hugging Face model/config directory instead.
    # cfg.model = AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained("/path/to/local/hf_model").to_megatron_provider(load_weights=False)

    # Optional: initialize weights from a converted Megatron checkpoint for SFT/PEFT
    # or other pretrained-weight workflows.
    # cfg.checkpoint.pretrained_checkpoint = "/path/to/megatron/checkpoint"

    # Override training parameters
    cfg.train.train_iters = 10
    cfg.scheduler.lr_decay_iters = 10000
    cfg.model.vocab_size = 8192
    cfg.tokenizer.vocab_size = cfg.model.vocab_size

    pretrain(cfg, forward_step)
```

You can launch the above script with:

```sh
uv run python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc-per-node=<num devices> /path/to/script.py
```

HF → Megatron conversion is workflow-specific. Use it when you need pretrained HF weights as a Megatron checkpoint,
such as for finetuning from converted weights or for checkpoint round-trip workflows. It is not required for
random-init pretraining from an HF architecture, where `AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained(...).to_megatron_provider(load_weights=False)`
only reads the architecture configuration.

For runnable recipe, data preparation, and training examples, see the repository
[`tutorials/`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/tree/main/tutorials) directory.
The [data tutorial index](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/blob/main/tutorials/data/README.md) compares pretraining, text-only SFT, direct Hugging Face SFT, and Energon workflows.

## Supported Models

Megatron Bridge provides out-of-the-box bridges and training recipes for a wide range of models, built on top of base model architectures from [Megatron Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core). Refer to the [models directory](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/tree/main/src/megatron/bridge/models) for the full list of model bridges.

> **Deprecation notice:** Gemma 1 (2B/7B), Gemma 2 (2B/9B/27B), Llama 2,
> Mistral 7B, Mistral Small 3 24B, Nemotron H v1 (4B/8B/47B/56B), and the
> legacy `NemotronForCausalLM` bridge previously documented for Nemotron-4 340B
> are no longer actively maintained or tested against current upstream
> checkpoints. They will be removed in Megatron Bridge 0.7.0.

### Launching Recipes

For a conceptual overview of how recipes are structured, overridden, and launched with either `torchrun` or NeMo-Run, read the [Using Recipes guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/megatron-bridge/latest/recipe-usage.html).

Runnable tutorials live in `tutorials/recipes/llama` that covers:

- `00_quickstart_pretrain.py` for mock-data pretraining
- `01_quickstart_finetune.py` + LoRA configs
- YAML-driven flows and launch helpers

Dataset preparation tutorials live in [`tutorials/data`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/tree/main/tutorials/data), including local/materialized text-only SFT and direct Hugging Face SFT examples.

## Performance Benchmarks

For detailed performance benchmarks including throughput metrics across different GPU systems (DGX-GB200, DGX-B200, DGX-H100) and model configurations, see the [Performance Summary](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/megatron-bridge/latest/performance-summary.html) in our documentation.

- [VeRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) has adopted Megatron-Bridge as a connector to Megatron-Core and for LoRA support.
- [Slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) has adopted Megatron-Bridge as Megatron-Core checkpoint converter.
- [SkyRL](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL) has adopted Megatron-Bridge as Megatron-Core connector.
- [Nemo-RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemo-rl) has adopted Megatron-Bridge as Megatron-Core connector.
