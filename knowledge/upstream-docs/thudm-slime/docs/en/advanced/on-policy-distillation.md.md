# On-Policy Distillation

On-policy distillation (OPD) trains a student on response tokens sampled from the student's current policy. At every visited prefix, a fixed teacher scores the same next token, providing a dense token-level learning signal along the student's own trajectories. In slime, this signal is a sampled reverse-KL penalty applied to the advantage, so it can be combined with an advantage estimator such as GRPO, PPO, or REINFORCE++. With zero task reward, the same mechanism performs pure distillation.

## Key Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--use-opd` | Enable on-policy distillation. Required flag to use OPD. |
| `--opd-type` | Type of OPD: `sglang` or `megatron`. Required when `--use-opd` is set. |
| `--opd-kl-coef` | OPD KL penalty coefficient (default: 1.0). Controls the weight of the distillation signal relative to the RL advantage. |
| `--opd-teacher-load` | Path to teacher Megatron checkpoint. **Required** when `--opd-type=megatron`, **must not be set** when `--opd-type=sglang`. |
| `--opd-teacher-ckpt-step` | Optional checkpoint step for teacher model. |

## How It Works

Let $\pi_\theta$ denote the student, $\pi_T$ the teacher, and $h_t$ the history before token $a_t$ on a student-generated trajectory. Following [Thinking Machines Lab's definition](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/on-policy-distillation/), the per-token reverse KL is

$$
D_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(\pi_\theta(\cdot \mid h_t) \| \pi_T(\cdot \mid h_t)\right)
= \mathbb{E}_{a_t \sim \pi_\theta(\cdot \mid h_t)}\left[
\log \pi_\theta(a_t \mid h_t) - \log \pi_T(a_t \mid h_t)
\right].
$$

The order is important: the student is the first argument of the KL, and the expectation is also over the student distribution. The teacher does not generate the training trajectory; it evaluates the token that the student actually sampled.

slime does not enumerate the full vocabulary to compute this expectation. For each sampled token, it uses the Monte Carlo contribution

$$
\hat d_t = \log \pi_\theta(a_t \mid h_t) - \log \pi_T(a_t \mid h_t),
\qquad a_t \sim \pi_\theta(\cdot \mid h_t),
$$

and modifies the base advantage as

$$
\hat A_t = A_t - \lambda_{\mathrm{opd}}\hat d_t.
$$

Here, $A_t$ is the advantage from the configured estimator (or zero for pure distillation), and $\lambda_{\mathrm{opd}}$ is `--opd-kl-coef`. An individual $\hat d_t$ may be negative even though the KL is non-negative in expectation. The policy loss uses $\hat A_t$, which makes the OPD term orthogonal to the choice of GRPO, PPO, REINFORCE++, GSPO, or another supported advantage estimator.

## Two Teacher Modes

### SGLang Mode (`--opd-type sglang`)

The teacher runs on an external SGLang server. Teacher log-probs are obtained during the rollout phase.

**When to use**: The teacher has a different architecture from the student, or the teacher is too large to load alongside the training model. Because the teacher scores the student's exact token IDs, the teacher and student must still use compatible tokenization and vocabularies.

**How it works**:
1. An external SGLang server runs the teacher model.
2. During rollout, the custom reward function (`slime.rollout.on_policy_distillation.reward_func`) sends the student's sampled token IDs to the teacher server and obtains the teacher log-probability of those same tokens.
3. The custom post-processing function (`slime.rollout.on_policy_distillation.post_process_rewards`) trims the teacher log-probs to the response span and stores them in `sample.teacher_log_probs`.
4. During training, slime subtracts the sampled log-probability difference, scaled by `--opd-kl-coef`, from the base advantage.

**Configuration**:
```bash
--use-opd
--opd-type sglang
--opd-kl-coef 1.0
--custom-rm-path slime.rollout.on_policy_distillation.reward_func
--custom-reward-post-process-path slime.rollout.on_policy_distillation.post_process_rewards
--rm-url http://<TEACHER_IP>:<TEACHER_PORT>/generate
```

### Megatron Mode (`--opd-type megatron`)

The teacher model is loaded directly into Megatron via `--opd-teacher-load`. Teacher log-probs are computed during the training forward pass.

**When to use**: The teacher has the same architecture as the student/reference model and fits in GPU memory.

**How it works**:
1. The teacher model is loaded as an additional Megatron model during initialization.
2. During the training forward pass, the teacher model computes log-probs for each sample.
3. The KL penalty is computed inline and applied to advantages.

**Configuration**:
```bash
--use-opd
--opd-type megatron
--opd-kl-coef 1.0
--opd-teacher-load /path/to/teacher_torch_dist
```

> **Note**: The teacher checkpoint must be in Megatron format (`torch_dist` or `torch`). You can convert from HuggingFace format using `tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py`.

## Running the Examples

Complete example scripts are provided in `examples/on_policy_distillation/`:

### SGLang Teacher

```bash
# 1. Download models and data

hf download Qwen/Qwen3-8B --local-dir /root/Qwen3-8B
hf download --repo-type dataset zhuzilin/dapo-math-17k --local-dir /root/dapo-math-17k

# 2. Convert student model
cd /root/slime
source scripts/models/qwen3-8B.sh
PYTHONPATH=/root/Megatron-LM python tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py \
    ${MODEL_ARGS[@]} \
    --hf-checkpoint /root/Qwen3-8B \
    --save /root/Qwen3-8B_torch_dist

# 3. Run
bash examples/on_policy_distillation/run-qwen3-8B-opd.sh
```

### Megatron Teacher

```bash
# 1. Convert both student and teacher models to Megatron format
# 2. Run
bash examples/on_policy_distillation/run-qwen3-8B-opd-megatron.sh
```

## Preliminary Results

Using Qwen3-8B-Base model SFT-ed on part of the [OpenThoughts3-1.2M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-thoughts/OpenThoughts3-1.2M) dataset, on-policy distillation with a Qwen3-32B teacher on the remaining data yields:

|                                  | Pass@1 |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|
| Qwen3-8B-Base + SFT                           | 76%    |
| Qwen3-8B-Base + SFT + On-Policy Distillation  | 94%    |
