# Metrics Tracking

AReaL provides a unified metrics tracking system that handles statistics collection
across distributed training and rollout workers. The system supports two distinct
paradigms optimized for their respective use cases: **streaming metrics** for
asynchronous rollout workflows and **batch metrics** for synchronous training updates.

## Core Components

The metrics system is built around `areal.utils.stats_tracker`, which provides:

- **Named trackers**: Isolated metric namespaces for different components
- **Hierarchical scoping**: Organize metrics into logical groups
- **Distributed aggregation**: Automatic reduction across workers
- **Multiple reduce types**: Support for averages, sums, min/max, and scalars

```python
from areal.utils import stats_tracker

# Default tracker (training metrics)
stats_tracker.scalar(learning_rate=0.001)

# Named tracker (rollout metrics)
stats_tracker.get("rollout").scalar(reward=0.5)
```

## Two Logging Paradigms

### Streaming Metrics (Rollout Workers)

Rollout workers execute workflows asynchronously, with each workflow logging metrics
independently. This streaming approach handles variable completion times naturally.

**Characteristics:**

- Each workflow logs scalars individually as they complete
- Metrics accumulate in a list within the worker process
- No synchronization between workers during logging
- Aggregation happens at export time via the controller

**Example from `RLVRWorkflow`:**

```python
# areal/workflow/rlvr.py
async def _collect_samples(self, engine, req, prompt_str, task_data):
    resp = await engine.agenerate(req)
    reward = await self._compute_rewards(resp, prompt_str, task_data)

    # Log single scalar - appends to internal list
    # `workflow_context.stat_scope()` automatically differentiates evaluation/training scopes
    stats_tracker.get(workflow_context.stat_scope()).scalar(reward=reward)

    return resp, reward
```

You can log any other scalars in your customized workflow, e.g.,

```python
async def run(self, data, **extra_kwargs):
    # `workflow_context.stat_scope()` automatically differentiates evaluation/training scopes
    stats_tracker.get(workflow_context.stat_scope()).scalar(num_turns=num_turns, max_tokens=max_tokens, reward=reward)
    return reward
```

**Controller aggregation:**

The `RolloutController` collects stats from all workers and computes weighted averages:

```python
# areal/infra/controller/rollout_controller.py
def export_stats(self) -> dict[str, float]:
    all_raw_stats = self._collective_rpc(method="export_stats")

    # Aggregate using counts as weights
    stats, counts = defaultdict(float), defaultdict(int)
    for raw_stats in all_raw_stats:
        for k, v in raw_stats.items():
            if k.endswith("__count"):
                counts[k] += v
            else:
                stats[k] += v * raw_stats.get(k + "__count", 0)

    # Compute weighted averages
    return {k: v / counts[k + "__count"] for k, v in stats.items()
            if counts.get(k + "__count", 0) > 0}
```

### Batch Metrics (Training Engines)

Training engines process data in synchronized batches across data-parallel ranks.
Metrics are logged as tensors with boolean masks, then reduced across all ranks at
export time.

**Characteristics:**

- Log entire batch tensors with denominator masks
- Support for per-token and per-sequence statistics
- All-reduce synchronization ensures consistent stats across ranks
- Multiple reduce types: `AVG_MIN_MAX`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`

**Example from `PPOActor`:**

```python
# areal/trainer/ppo/actor.py
def ppo_update(self, data):
    loss_mask = data["loss_mask"].bool()
    reward_score = data["rewards"]

    # Define denominators (boolean masks)
    stats_tracker.denominator(
        n_seqs=torch.ones_like(reward_score, dtype=torch.bool),
        n_valid_tokens=loss_mask,
    )

    # Log tensor metrics with denominator reference
    stats_tracker.stat(
        advantages=data["advantages"],      # [batch, seq_len]
        kl_rewards=data["kl_rewards"],      # [batch, seq_len]
        denominator="n_valid_tokens"
    )

    stats_tracker.stat(
        task_reward=reward_score.float(),   # [batch]
        seq_len=seqlens.float(),            # [batch]
        denominator="n_seqs"
    )
```

**Export behavior:**

```python
# areal/engine/fsdp_engine.py
def export_stats(self) -> dict[str, float]:
    # All-reduce across data-parallel group
    return stats_tracker.export_all(reduce_group=self.data_parallel_group)
    # All DP ranks receive identical results
```

## API Reference

### Recording Methods

| Method                        | Use Case                    | Example                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `scalar(**kwargs)`            | Single float values         | `scalar(lr=0.001, eps=0.2)`              |
| `denominator(**kwargs)`       | Define boolean masks        | `denominator(valid=mask.bool())`         |
| `stat(denominator, **kwargs)` | Tensor metrics with masking | `stat(loss=tensor, denominator="valid")` |

### Reduce Types

When using `stat()`, metrics default to `AVG_MIN_MAX`, which creates three output keys:

```python
stats_tracker.stat(loss=tensor, denominator="valid")
# Exports: {"loss/avg": 0.5, "loss/min": 0.1, "loss/max": 0.9}
```

Available reduce types:

| Type          | Output                          | Description              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `AVG_MIN_MAX` | `key/avg`, `key/min`, `key/max` | Default for tensor stats |
| `AVG`         | `key`                           | Weighted average only    |
| `SUM`         | `key`                           | Sum across all elements  |
| `MIN`         | `key`                           | Minimum value            |
| `MAX`         | `key`                           | Maximum value            |
| `SCALAR`      | `key`, `key__count`             | For scalar values        |

### Scoping

Organize related metrics using hierarchical scopes:

```python
with stats_tracker.scope("ppo_actor"):
    with stats_tracker.scope("update"):
        stats_tracker.stat(loss=loss_tensor, denominator="valid")
        # Key: "ppo_actor/update/loss/avg"
```

### Timing

Measure execution time with automatic scoping under `timeperf/`:

```python
with stats_tracker.record_timing("rollout"):
    batch = actor.prepare_batch(dataloader, workflow)
# Key: "timeperf/rollout"
```

### Named Trackers

Isolate metrics for different components:

```python
# Training metrics (default tracker)
stats_tracker.scalar(grad_norm=1.5)

# Rollout metrics
stats_tracker.get("rollout").scalar(reward=0.8)

# Evaluation metrics
stats_tracker.get("eval-rollout").scalar(reward=0.9)

# Export from all trackers
all_stats = stats_tracker.export_all(reduce_group=group)
```

If `evaluator.eval_before_train: true`, evaluation runs once before the first training
step to get an estimate of the initial model's performance before finetuning.

## Data Flow

## StatsLogger: Logging Backends

The
[`StatsLogger`](https://github.com/areal-project/AReaL/blob/main/areal/utils/stats_logger.py)
sends aggregated metrics to external logging backends. It is automatically managed by
`PPOTrainer` and runs only on rank 0 to avoid duplicate logging.

### Supported Backends

| Backend              | Configuration                     | Description                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Weights & Biases** | `config.stats_logger.wandb`       | Cloud-based experiment tracking |
| **SwanLab**          | `config.stats_logger.swanlab`     | Alternative experiment tracking |
| **TensorBoard**      | `config.stats_logger.tensorboard` | Local visualization             |

### Integration with PPOTrainer

The trainer calls `StatsLogger.commit()` at the end of each training step:

```python
# areal/trainer/rl_trainer.py
def _export_and_commit_stats(self, epoch, epoch_step, global_step):
    # 1. Collect metrics from all components
    stats = self.actor.export_stats()           # Training metrics (all-reduced)
    stats.update(self.rollout.export_stats())   # Rollout metrics (controller-aggregated)
    stats.update(self.eval_rollout.export_stats())  # Eval metrics

    # 2. Send to logging backends (rank 0 only)
    self.stats_logger.commit(epoch, epoch_step, global_step, stats)
```

### StatsLogger.commit()

The `commit()` method filters out internal count keys and logs to all configured
backends:

```python
# areal/utils/stats_logger.py
def commit(self, epoch, step, global_step, data):
    if dist.is_initialized() and dist.get_rank() != 0:
        return  # Only rank 0 logs

    # Filter out __count keys (used internally for weighted averaging)
    data = {k: v for k, v in data.items() if not k.endswith("__count")}

    # Log to all backends
    wandb.log(data, step=global_step)
    swanlab.log(data, step=global_step)
    if self.summary_writer:
        for key, val in data.items():
            self.summary_writer.add_scalar(key, val, global_step)
```

### Configuration

Configure logging backends in your experiment config:

```yaml
stats_logger:
  experiment_name: "gsm8k_grpo"
  trial_name: "run_001"
  fileroot: "/path/to/logs"

  wandb:
    mode: "online"  # "online", "offline", or "disabled"
    project: "my-project"
    entity: "my-team"

  swanlab:
    mode: "online"  # "online", "local", or "disabled"
    project: "my-project"

  tensorboard:
    path: "/path/to/tensorboard/logs"  # null to disable
```

## Training Diagnostics

When recomputed proximal log-probabilities are available during advantage preprocessing,
`ppo_actor/train_infer/` compares them with the original rollout log-probabilities
**before** standard PPO replaces those values. This requires no additional model forward
pass. Runs without recomputation and pure MOPD preprocessing do not emit this namespace.

Let `d = log(p_trainer) - log(p_rollout)` on aligned, valid generated tokens:

| Metric                                                                                           | Definition                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `logp_diff/{avg,min,max}`                                                                        | Signed difference `d`                       |
| `logp_abs_diff/{avg,min,max}`                                                                    | Absolute difference `abs(d)`                |
| `logp_diff_squared`                                                                              | Token-weighted mean of `d²`                 |
| `trainer_nll`, `rollout_nll`                                                                     | Mean negative sampled-token log-probability |
| `kl_k1`, `kl_k2`, `kl_k3`                                                                        | Means of `-d`, `d²/2`, and `exp(d)-1-d`     |
| `ratio_outside_1.5`, `ratio_outside_2`, `ratio_outside_3`, `ratio_outside_5`, `ratio_outside_10` | Fraction with `abs(d) > log(threshold)`     |

These metrics use the generation mask before subsequent rejection/advantage masking. For
stale rollouts, differences include policy drift, not just numerical engine
disagreement. KL estimates also depend on the sampling distribution, filtering, and
log-probability convention. The `k1` sample estimate can be negative; `k2` is a local
approximation. The mean squared difference and absolute mean permit deriving the
population standard deviation of absolute differences after aggregation:
`sqrt(max(0, E[d²] - E[abs(d)]²))`.

The ratio tail definition matches the extreme token fraction in
[R3, Equation (3)](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.11370v1). For samples drawn from the
reported rollout distribution with matching support, `k1` and `k3` estimate
`KL(rollout || trainer)`. Returned logprobs are not necessarily those of the actual
sampling distribution after top-p/top-k filtering or greedy selection.

`nonfinite_logp_fraction` reports the fraction of valid tokens for which either logprob
is NaN or infinite. If any such token participates, ratio tail metrics are NaN rather
than silently classifying invalid comparisons as zero. Masked padding does not
contribute to this fraction or contaminate the tails. `kl_k3_overflow_fraction` reports
finite-input gaps whose `expm1` exceeds float64.

`ppo_actor/advantage_{positive,negative,zero}_fraction` uses the shaped input advantages
and batch loss mask **before M2/rejection filtering**. It measures token occupancy, not
task success or gradient signs. GSPO can further aggregate advantages by sequence inside
the loss.

`ppo_actor/update/version_stats/sample_staleness_{theta,proximal}_{avg,min,max}` uses
generated tokens with nonnegative versions. Averages are token-weighted and extrema are
global over the reduction group. Both legacy theta/proximal keys use the last published
checkpoint version: actor and rollout versions advance together after a PPO update. They
do not track intermediate optimizer minibatches. `stale_token_fraction` counts behavior
versions older than that checkpoint; `future_token_fraction` counts newer versions. Raw
rollout versions are shifted to prediction positions locally for this diagnostic,
including pure MOPD batches. This does not change the existing version-aware proximal
approximation used in the loss. The population is the batch **before M2/rejection
filtering**, counted once per `_ppo_update`, independently of minibatch forwards.
`n_valid_generated_tokens` sums these observations; reused trajectories in separate
updates are counted again. Empty populations omit averages and extrema rather than
reporting a fabricated zero.

New diagnostics use `stat_compact`: each metric stores only four float64 scalars (masked
sum, count, minimum, maximum) per batch until export. This avoids the former
approximately 106 bytes of retained diagnostic tensors per padded token. Existing PPO
statistics still retain their own full tensors, and the transient computation of
summaries still allocates per-token tensors. Long-context peak memory and runtime
overhead require workload-specific validation.

The optional loglinear proximal approximation still uses raw token-position rollout
versions and its original `current_version - 1` interpolation assumption. Those
pre-existing algorithm semantics require separate step-level validation; the
checkpoint-age diagnostics above are not evidence that they are corrected.

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the right paradigm**: Use `scalar()` for scalars, `stat()` with denominators
   for batched pytorch tensors (usually training metrics).

1. **Define denominators first**: Always call `denominator()` before `stat()` to
   establish the masking relationship.

1. **Use named trackers**: Use
   `stats_tracker.get(workflow_context.stat_scope()).scalar(...)` to isolate rollout
   (`"rollout"`) and evaluation (`"eval-rollout"`) metrics from training metrics.

## Training throughput, estimated FLOPs, and MoE balance

Archon, Megatron, and FSDP export training work under `train_perf`. Each interval spans
all `train_batch` calls since the previous statistics export (including repeated PPO
updates). Tokens are the sum of the original attention masks: prompt and response both
count, masked padding does not. Counts are summed across data-parallel replicas only;
TP, CP/SP, PP and EP do not multiply the logical batch size.

Timing spans batch preparation, forward, backward and optimizer work, starting before
gradient zeroing. CUDA/ROCm uses events on the captured training stream and waits once
per device at statistics export, without adding per-batch synchronization. This measures
stream elapsed time, including stream waits and host submission gaps after the start
event executes; side-stream work not joined before the end event is excluded. It is not
a device-wide synchronized wall-time measurement. CPU/NPU retain synchronized wall
timing. Rollout, reference/evaluation forwards, loading the next batch, checkpointing
and statistics export are excluded. The denominator is the maximum accumulated training
time across training ranks.

| Metric                                                | Meaning                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `train_perf/tokens`                                   | Global logical tokens processed in this export interval |
| `train_perf/seconds`                                  | Training time for this interval                         |
| `train_perf/tokens_per_second`                        | Interval tokens / interval seconds                      |
| `train_perf/estimated_flops`                          | Sum of per-sequence forward + backward FLOPs            |
| `train_perf/estimated_flops_per_second`               | Estimated interval FLOPs / interval seconds             |
| `train_perf/total_tokens`, `train_perf/total_seconds` | Totals since engine initialization                      |
| `train_perf/cumulative_tokens_per_second`             | Total tokens / total training time                      |
| `train_perf/cumulative_estimated_flops_per_second`    | Total estimated FLOPs / total training time             |

These are aggregate training-cluster rates, not per-GPU rates. Cumulative counters
restart when the engine is recreated, including checkpoint recovery. Unsupported model
architectures still log tokens and time, but omit FLOPs metrics.

### FLOPs registration and conventions

`areal.utils.flops` provides factories for `qwen3_moe` and `qwen3_5_moe[_text]`,
including Qwen3-30B-A3B and Qwen3.5-35B-A3B. The actual checkpoint's text configuration
supplies dimensions, so a local checkpoint directory works without name matching. The
reference dimensions are from the official
[Qwen3 configuration](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B/blob/main/config.json)
and
[Qwen3.5 configuration](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B/blob/main/config.json).

A multiply-add counts as two FLOPs. The estimate is three times forward work (forward
plus an estimated two-times-forward backward). It includes selected routed expert
projections, routers, shared experts and their gate, attention projections, and the
language-model head. Causal full attention includes
`2 * query_heads * head_dim * L * (L + 1)` forward FLOPs per full-attention layer. For
packed batches, sum `estimate(L_i)` over individual sequences; do not use
`estimate(sum(L_i))`.

Qwen3.5 accounts separately for its full-attention layers and linear-attention
GatedDeltaNet layers, including gated projections and depthwise convolution. DeltaNet
uses a recurrent-equivalent estimate of three key-by-value multiply-adds per value head
per token (state prediction, update and readout). Its work grows linearly with sequence
length. This is a model-math estimate, not a count of the extra operations used by a
particular chunked kernel implementation.

These estimates exclude activation recomputation, optimizer math, elementwise
operations, softmax/normalization, auxiliary MTP branches and the vision encoder. They
describe a full-parameter text-model training workload, not measured hardware FLOPs,
exact LoRA/frozen-parameter backward work, or vision-model FLOPs. Tree training reports
logical per-sequence work; shared-prefix savings are not subtracted.

Register a custom factory in **each training worker before engine initialization**:

```python
from areal.utils.flops import register_flops_estimator


def my_model_factory(config):
    # Return a callable whose only input is one sequence's length.
    active_parameters = config.active_parameters
    heads = config.num_attention_heads
    head_dim = config.head_dim
    layers = config.num_hidden_layers

    def total_training_flops(sequence_length: int) -> float:
        linear = 6 * active_parameters * sequence_length
        attention = 6 * layers * heads * head_dim * sequence_length * (sequence_length + 1)
        return float(linear + attention)

Registration replaces any existing factory for that model type. Registering only in a
controller process does not register it in remote training workers.

### MoE balance and W&B visualization

MoE diagnostics use the independent `moe_balance` scope. Archon supports its common MoE
module, Megatron supports `TopKRouter`, and FSDP supports the Transformers
`Qwen3MoeTopKRouter` and `Qwen3_5MoeTopKRouter` contracts. Decoder layer IDs are
zero-based and global across pipeline stages. Shared experts and auxiliary MTP routers
are excluded. Unsupported routers do not emit MoE diagnostics.

For each layer, let `c_e` be the accumulated routing assignments to expert `e`, and `E`
the number of routed experts:

- Expert load percentage: `100 * c_e / sum(c_e)`; one layer sums to 100%.
- Ideal load: `sum(c_e) / E`, including top-k assignment multiplicity.
- `moe_balance/layer_<id>/max_over_ideal`: `max(c_e) / (sum(c_e) / E)`; perfect balance
  is 1. Empty layers report zeros.

Counts are reduced before normalization, so unequal microbatches and data-parallel
shards are weighted correctly. Only original training forwards count; evaluation and
checkpoint backward recomputation do not. These are **executed routing loads**:
packing/alignment padding is included; Megatron counts its post-capacity/drop routing
map. Consequently routed counts can differ from logical throughput token counts.

W&B receives one `moe_balance/expert_loads` Table per logged step with columns `layer`,
`expert`, `tokens`, and `load_percent`. Per-layer `max_over_ideal` remains a scalar.
This avoids thousands of individual W&B expert scalar series. SwanLab and Trackio retain
`moe_balance/layer_<id>/expert_<id>/{tokens,load_percent}`. TensorBoard and the console
report layer summaries without individual expert scalar series.

Recommended panels, built with
[W&B custom charts](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/app/features/custom-charts):

1. **Layer × expert heatmap at a selected step:** color by `load_percent`, with tokens
   in the tooltip. Keep expert order fixed. For cross-model comparisons, derive
   `load_percent / (100 / E)` and center the color scale at 1.
1. **Step × layer heatmap:** color by `max_over_ideal` to locate when a layer becomes
   imbalanced. This uses the per-layer scalar history.
1. **Single-layer expert bar chart:** filter the table by layer and draw an ideal
   reference line at `100 / E`. Keep expert IDs on the x-axis to reveal persistent hot
   or idle experts.

Use `historyTable` and the step selector to switch snapshots directly. To display
multiple steps simultaneously in a Table-based chart, combine snapshots with their log
steps in postprocessing. Per-layer maximum load ratios already have scalar history.
Quantiles, entropy, and coefficient of variation can be derived from the raw loads.
