Memory Requirements

API To Estimate Memory Usage
============================

ZeRO2:

.. autofunction:: deepspeed.runtime.zero.stage_1_and_2.estimate_zero2_model_states_mem_needs_all_live

.. autofunction:: deepspeed.runtime.zero.stage_1_and_2.estimate_zero2_model_states_mem_needs_all_cold

Examples:

Let's try a 3B model with just 1 node with 8 gpus, using live model:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c 'from transformers import AutoModel; \
    from deepspeed.runtime.zero.stage_1_and_2 import estimate_zero2_model_states_mem_needs_all_live; \
    model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("t5-3b"); \
    estimate_zero2_model_states_mem_needs_all_live(model, num_gpus_per_node=8, num_nodes=1)'

    Estimated memory needed for params, optim states and gradients for a:
    HW: Setup with 1 node, 8 GPUs per node.
    SW: Model with 2851M total params.
      per CPU  |  per GPU |   Options
      127.48GB |   5.31GB | offload_optimizer=cpu
      127.48GB |  15.93GB | offload_optimizer=none

Now, without the actual model, which requires us to know ``total_params`` and
``largest_layer_params``, but we got those from the run above, so future estimators are now much
faster as we don't need to load the model.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c 'from deepspeed.runtime.zero.stage_1_and_2 import estimate_zero2_model_states_mem_needs_all_cold; \
    estimate_zero2_model_states_mem_needs_all_cold(total_params=2851e6, num_gpus_per_node=8, num_nodes=1)'

    Estimated memory needed for params, optim states and gradients for a:
    HW: Setup with 1 node, 8 GPUs per node.
    SW: Model with 2851M total params.
      per CPU  |  per GPU |   Options
      127.45GB |   5.31GB | offload_optimizer=cpu
      127.45GB |  15.93GB | offload_optimizer=none

There is a slight difference due to rounding - the actual live model has a few more params

There is a slight difference due to rounding - the actual live model has a few more params



Discussion
==========

Let's look in detail how the memory estimator API calculates these numbers and also discuss some additional numbers that aren't covered by the API.

In the following discussion:

- ``params`` - total number of model params, which can be calculated as:

.. code-block:: python

    print(sum(dict((p.data_ptr(), p.numel()) for p in model.parameters()).values()))

Some models already include the number of params in the model name, e.g. t5-11b (11B params), gpt-neo-1.3B (1.3B params), etc.

Also if the model weights are stored in ``fp32`` the other quick way to calculate the size of the model is to simply divide the size of the ``state_dict`` file by 4 (fp32 == 4 bytes). For example, you can see that `t5-11b's pytorch_model.bin <https://huggingface.co/t5-11b/tree/main>`__ is 42.1GB in size, so if we divide it by 4, we can immediately tell it's an 11B model.

The following calculations show how much memory is required by model params, gradients and optimizer states. In addition to those you will need enough memory to fit activation calculations and any temporary memory for intermediate calculations, which for long sequences could be very significant (e.g. could take the same amount of memory as params+grads+optim_states combined).

The optimizer states assume that ``Adam`` is used, where 4 bytes per parameter are used by momentum and another 4 by variance (8 in total).

Gradients at ``fp32`` take 4 bytes, and parameters take 2 bytes at ``fp16`` and 4 bytes at ``fp32``.

**GPU RAM**

The big question is how big of a model you can fit on the hardware you have? Or rather what size of a GPU RAM do you need to fit the desired model.


* ZeRO-2:

   - ``"offload_optimizer": {"device": "cpu"}``: 2 * params

   Example: a 40GB GPU can fit ~11B param model (regardless of how many GPUs are used). Here the model is loaded in ``fp16`` so just the model weights take about 22GB and the remaining 18GB are used by other components. You can barely fit a very small batch size in this scenario.

   - ``"offload_optimizer": {"device": "none"}``: 4 * params + 16 * params/ (total number of gpus)

* ZeRO-3:

``largest_layer_memory = 4*largest_layer_params`` - GPU memory needed to gather the largest layer on a single GPU. 2 bytes fp16 params are gathered and 2 bytes fp16 grads are computed (total 4x). The optimizer states and fp32 parameters are updated in partitioned form and copied to fp16 params in partitioned form. This happens during the optimizer step. After that the fp16 params are sufficient.

   - case 1: ``"offload_param": {"device": "none"}, "offload_optimizer": {"device": "none"}`` - largest_layer_memory + 18 * params / total number of gpus across all nodes
   - case 2: ``"offload_param": {"device": "cpu"}, "offload_optimizer": {"device": "cpu"}``- largest_layer_memory. The main limit here is general RAM.
   - case 3: ``"offload_param": {"device": "none"}, "offload_optimizer": {"device": "cpu"}``- largest_layer_memory + 2 * params / total number of gpus across all nodes

     Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from transformers import AutoModel
    model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("t5-large")

    # shared params calculated only ones
    total_params = sum(dict((p.data_ptr(), p.numel()) for p in model.parameters()).values())

    largest_layer_params = 0
    for m in model.modules():
        # assuming no shared params within a single layer
        layer_params = sum(p.numel() for p in m.parameters(recurse=False))
        largest_layer_params = max(largest_layer_params, layer_params)

    largest_layer_memory = (4*largest_layer_params)

    total_gpus = 4

    case1 = largest_layer_memory + int(18*total_params/total_gpus)
    case2 = largest_layer_memory
    case3 = largest_layer_memory + int(2*total_params/total_gpus)

    print(f"total params:         {total_params/1e6:6.2f}M")
    print(f"largest layer params: {largest_layer_params/1e6:6.2f}M")
    print(f"largest layer memory: {largest_layer_memory>>20:6}MB")
    print(f"case1 gpu memory: {(case1)>>20:6}MB")
    print(f"case2 gpu memory: {(case2)>>20:6}MB")
    print(f"case3 gpu memory: {(case3)>>20:6}MB")

    total params:         737.67M
    largest layer params:  32.90M
    largest layer memory:    125MB
    case1 gpu memory:   3291MB
    case2 gpu memory:    125MB
    case3 gpu memory:    477MB


**General RAM**:

One of the key features of ZeRO is its CPU offload which can dramatically extend the total memory pool accessible to the project by using general RAM. One can easily expand their general RAM by 10x times, at a significantly lower cost than what it'd take to have the same GPU RAM. And often, it's not even possible to buy GPUs with a lot of RAM (112GB GPU anybody?) since they simply don't yet exist.

In the following calculations we will use:

- ``additional_buffer_factor=1.5`` as an additional buffer factor to be conservative
- ``n_gpus`` the number of GPUs on a single node (machine)
- ``total_gpus`` the total number of GPUs across all nodes
- ``params`` - total number of model params (see above for how to get this number)

* ZeRO-2:

   - ``"offload_optimizer": {"device": "none"}``:

      params * 4 * n_gpus * additional_buffer_factor - this is the memory needed only at the beginning to initialize the model on CPU memory

   - ``"offload_optimizer": {"device": "cpu"}``:

      params * max(4 * n_gpus, 16) * additional_buffer_factor

   Example: xxx

* ZeRO-3:

   gpus_factor = n_gpus / total_gpus

   - case 1: ``"offload_param": {"device": "none"}, "offload_optimizer": {"device": "none"}``:

      Without ``zero.Init``:

          params * 4 * n_gpus * additional_buffer_factor

          this is the memory needed only at the beginning to initialize the model on CPU memory. Once the model is transferred to GPUs this memory is freed.

      With ``zero.Init``:

          largest_layer_params * 4 * n_gpus * additional_buffer_factor

          assuming Pytorch is deallocating the memory once the tensors are moved to the GPU by ZeRO.Init

   - case 2: ``"offload_param": {"device": "cpu"}, "offload_optimizer": {"device": "cpu"}``:

      Without ``zero.Init``:

          params * max(4 * n_gpus, 18 * gpus_factor) * additional_buffer_factor

      With ``zero.Init``:

          params * 18 * gpus_factor * additional_buffer_factor

   - case 3: ``"offload_param": {"device": "none"}, "offload_optimizer": {"device": "cpu"}``:

      Without ``zero.Init``:

          params * max(4 * n_gpus, 16 * gpus_factor) * additional_buffer_factor

      With ``zero.Init``:

          params * 16 * gpus_factor * additional_buffer_factor


Here is a breakdown for the 16 and 18 multipliers (b = bytes):

4 (in ``4*n_gpus``):

- when pytorch creates a model it creates it in fp32 by default (4 bytes)

16:

- 16b for fp32: 4b params, 4b grads, 4b momentum and 4b variance per parameter

18:

- 16b for fp32: 4b params, 4b grads, 4b momentum and 4b variance per parameter
- +2b for fp16 params

Note about gradients: While gradients are stored in fp16 (2 bytes), during the weight update, all of them are converted into fp32 before doing the weight updates since the weight updates are done at almost the entire model granularity (param_group granularity) in FusedAdam Optimizer in DeepSpeed. So after that conversion we would need the 4 bytes per gradient for nearly the entire set of weights.


**Pinned Memory**

Pinned general RAM is included in normal general RAM allocations (i.e. this is not extra memory allocations but simply shows how much of the general RAM is pinned). Pinning is controlled by the ``pin_memory`` field of ``offload_optimizer`` / ``offload_param`` (both default to ``true``); set to ``false`` on hosts with tight memlock limits (``ulimit -l``). See :ref:`host-memory-pinning` for how host memory is page-locked (``torch`` vs ``native`` backends).

* ZeRO-1/2: controlled by ``offload_optimizer.pin_memory`` (fp32 master weights / gradients and related offload scratch buffers may be pinned on the host)

* ZeRO-3 with ``offload_param.pin_memory=true``: partitioned fp16/bf16 parameter buffers on CPU may also be pinned.

With pinning enabled on ZeRO-3 there are 2 sub-cases:

1. ``offload_param`` enabled (``device: cpu``):

   - 6 * params (2b for fp16 params + 4b for fp32 gradients)
   - if ``gradient_accumulation_steps > 1`` an additional 2b for fp16 gradients are pinned

2. ``offload_param`` not enabled:

   - 4b for fp32 gradients

Exact pinned volume also depends on gradient-accumulation and other offload scratch buffers.


**Activation Memory**

XXX: For Transformers is probably around (2* seq * attn_heads + 16 * hidden_size) * sequence * batch/gpu

This needs to be completed.


.. _host-memory-pinning:

Host Memory Pinning
-----------------------

DeepSpeed page-locks (pins) host memory so DMA engines can move data efficiently
between CPU RAM and accelerators or NVMe. All pinning goes through the accelerator
APIs:

.. code-block:: python

    from deepspeed.accelerator import get_accelerator

    pinned = get_accelerator().pin_memory(tensor)          # default: copy + match shape
    assert get_accelerator().is_pinned(pinned)
    get_accelerator().unpin_memory(pinned)                # no-op for the torch backend

``pin_memory`` accepts ``make_copy`` and ``match_shape`` (both default ``True``) so
callers can either allocate a shaped copy of ``tensor`` or obtain a flat locked
buffer for later filling. With ``make_copy=False`` the input is only a
shape/dtype template: both backends page-lock a fresh buffer and never read
``tensor``, so scratch destinations do not pay for a second full-size
allocation and a copy.

Empty scratch buffers should use ``pin_empty`` / ``pin_empty_like`` instead of
``pin_memory(torch.empty(...), make_copy=False)``. Those helpers take a shape
and dtype only, so neither backend allocates a full-size pageable template.

.. code-block:: python

    scratch = get_accelerator().pin_empty_like(src, device='cpu')
    scratch = get_accelerator().pin_empty(1024, dtype=torch.float32, device='cpu')

Pin on/off vs backend
=====================

Whether to pin and how to pin are orthogonal:

* **On/off:** ``zero_optimization.offload_*.pin_memory`` (ZeRO CPU offload),
  ``use_pin_memory`` on eager activation checkpoint offload
  (``CheckpointHiddenStatesOffload``), and
  ``compile.offload_activation_pin_memory`` (DeepCompile activation offload).
  All default to pinning so async copies can use full DMA bandwidth; set
  false only under tight memlock limits (``ulimit -l``).
* **How:** ``DS_PIN_MEMORY_BACKEND=torch|native`` (environment only; not a
  ``ds_config`` field). Every call site that pins through
  ``get_accelerator().pin_memory()`` honors this env var, including ZeRO
  CPU-offload buffers and eager activation checkpoint offload. Keep the default
  ``torch`` backend for activation offload: ``native`` is ``mlock`` without
  ``cudaHostRegister``, so its host buffers are not registered for accelerator
  DMA and the offload's async copies can still block. DeepCompile activation
  offload pins with ATen ``pinned_memory`` and does **not** use
  ``DS_PIN_MEMORY_BACKEND``.

Backend Selection
=================

Whether to pin ZeRO CPU/NVMe offload buffers is controlled by
``zero_optimization.offload_param.pin_memory`` /
``zero_optimization.offload_optimizer.pin_memory`` (both default ``true``).
That is independent of **how** pages are locked.

The pinning **backend** (Torch vs DeepSpeed native) is selected only with the
``DS_PIN_MEMORY_BACKEND`` environment variable (default ``torch``). There is
no ``ds_config`` field for the backend.

The ``torch`` backend page-locks host memory for **accelerator DMA**
(``cudaHostRegister`` / device-specific pin). The ``native`` backend
page-locks via ``posix_memalign`` + ``mlock`` for AIO/GDS (DeepNVMe can
skip bounce buffers) and does **not** register the allocation with CUDA/XPU,
so async GPU copies to native-pinned tensors can still block. Both are
counted by ``track_pinned_memory`` when pages are actually locked. Differences:

     - Torch pinned status (``tensor.is_pinned()``)
     - ``.ds_pinned`` and process-wide pointer ranges (slices/views included)
   * - ``unpin_memory``
     - No-op (returns ``None``)
     - Frees the mlocked allocation immediately (returns ``True`` on success)
   * - Lifetime / free
     - Freed when the tensor is garbage-collected (PyTorch)
     - ``weakref`` finalizer frees on GC; prefer explicit ``unpin_memory`` for long-lived buffers (e.g. ZeRO ``destroy()``)
   * - CPU accelerator
     - Historical no-op (torch cannot pin CPU tensors); accounting skipped
     - Real ``mlock`` pins; accounting applies

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    export DS_PIN_MEMORY_BACKEND=native
    deepspeed train.py ...

Native device registration
==========================

Native allocations are device-independent ``mlock`` buffers. DeepSpeed
additionally registers them with the device through the accelerator's
host-memory registration hook, so PyTorch can use them for asynchronous
H2D/D2H DMA. Accelerators declare the alignment required for registered host
memory via ``pin_memory_alignment``; native buffers are rounded down and
size-padded to it before registration. Device registration is enabled by
default and can be disabled for comparison or debugging:

.. code-block:: bash

    export DS_PIN_MEMORY_BACKEND=native
    export DS_PIN_MEMORY_REGISTER_DEVICE=0  # mlock only; default is 1

``DS_PIN_MEMORY_REGISTER_DEVICE`` accepts ``1``/``0``, ``true``/``false``,
``yes``/``no``, and ``on``/``off``. Accelerators without a registration hook
continue to use the device-independent ``mlock`` buffer. If registration fails,
DeepSpeed logs a warning and retains the valid ``mlock`` allocation for CPU and
AIO use.

Requirements for native
=======================

* The DeepSpeed **pin_memory** op must build and load successfully. If
  ``pin_memory`` cannot be constructed, selecting ``native`` fails early rather
  than silently falling back to ``torch``.
* The process must be allowed to lock the requested host memory (see
  ``ulimit -l`` / ``memlock`` limits). Large ZeRO CPU-offload footprints can
  otherwise hit the memlock ceiling.

Lifetime and unpinning (native)
================================

Native-pinned allocations are tracked by a process-wide manager. Lifetime
matches ``torch.pin_memory`` as closely as possible:

* Dropping the returned tensor frees the locked pages via a ``weakref``
  finalizer (no explicit unpin required for short-lived buffers).
* Prefer ``get_accelerator().unpin_memory(tensor)`` when you know a buffer is
  finished, so mlocked memory is released immediately instead of waiting on
  garbage collection. ZeRO / ZenFlow optimizers do this for their owned
  CPU-offload buffers in ``destroy()``.
* After ``unpin_memory``, the tensor storage must not be used (use-after-free).
* Unlike the torch pinned allocator, native allocations are **not** stream
  tracked: they are freed as soon as the last reference drops, even if an
  asynchronous copy is still reading them. Code that issues
  ``non_blocking=True`` copies out of a native-pinned buffer must keep a
  reference to it until it synchronizes.

``is_pinned`` reports ``True`` for both torch-pinned tensors and native-managed
buffers, including slices/views whose storage falls inside a managed range.
