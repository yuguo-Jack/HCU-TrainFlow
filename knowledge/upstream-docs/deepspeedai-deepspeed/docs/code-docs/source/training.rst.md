Training API
############

:func:`deepspeed.initialize` returns a *training engine* in its first argument
of type :class:`DeepSpeedEngine`. This engine is used to progress training:

.. code-block:: python

    for step, batch in enumerate(data_loader):
        #forward() method
        loss = model_engine(batch)

        #runs backpropagation
        model_engine.backward(loss)

        #weight update
        model_engine.step()

Note that ``model_engine.backward()`` accepts only a scalar loss tensor produced by a forward pass.
Starting from v0.18.3, DeepSpeed also supports direct calls to ``tensor.backward()``. You can now call
``loss.backward()`` or ``tensor.backward(out_grad)`` when your PyTorch version supports the necessary APIs.
If your PyTorch version does not support these APIs, a direct call to ``tensor.backward()`` will raise an error.

Forward Propagation
-------------------
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.forward

Backward Propagation
--------------------
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.backward

Loss Scaling for Manual Backward Passes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.scale

When using mixed precision training (fp16, bf16, or torch.autocast), DeepSpeed applies loss scaling
to prevent gradient underflow. If you prefer to call ``loss.backward()`` directly instead of
``engine.backward(loss)``, you must use ``engine.scale(loss)`` to apply the appropriate loss scaler:

.. code-block:: python

    # Option 1: Use engine.backward() (recommended)
    loss = model_engine(batch)
    model_engine.backward(loss)

    # Option 2: Manual backward with scaling
    loss = model_engine(batch)
    scaled_loss = model_engine.scale(loss)
    scaled_loss.backward()

Both approaches produce identical gradients. The ``scale()`` method automatically applies the
appropriate scaler based on your configuration (ZeRO optimizer scaler, torch.autocast GradScaler, etc.).

Optimizer Step
--------------
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.step

Gradient Accumulation
---------------------
DeepSpeed accumulates gradients over ``gradient_accumulation_steps`` micro-batches
before averaging them and applying an optimizer step. The ``managed_gradient_accumulation``
config flag (default ``true``) controls who decides when that accumulation boundary occurs.

.. autofunction:: deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.is_gradient_accumulation_boundary

Managed Gradient Accumulation (default)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With ``"managed_gradient_accumulation": true`` (the default), DeepSpeed tracks an
internal micro-step counter and treats every ``gradient_accumulation_steps``-th
micro-batch as the accumulation boundary
(``(micro_steps + 1) % gradient_accumulation_steps == 0``). Only on that boundary does
``step()`` reduce gradients and apply the optimizer update, so you can call
``forward``/``backward``/``step`` symmetrically on every micro-batch:

.. code-block:: python

    for step, batch in enumerate(data_loader):
        loss = model_engine(batch)
        model_engine.backward(loss)
        model_engine.step()   # optimizer runs only on the accumulation boundary

Unmanaged Gradient Accumulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With ``"managed_gradient_accumulation": false``, micro-step tracking is disabled and the
caller owns the accumulation boundary. ``backward()`` only accumulates gradients, and each
``step()`` finalizes the accumulated gradients and applies exactly one optimizer update. You
are responsible for calling ``step()`` when accumulation is complete:

.. code-block:: python

    # ds_config = {..., "managed_gradient_accumulation": False}
    for step_batches in batched_micro_batches:            # caller decides the boundary
        num_micro_batches = len(step_batches)             # may differ from gradient_accumulation_steps
        for micro_batch in step_batches:
            loss = model_engine(micro_batch)
            # scale_wrt_gas=False disables DeepSpeed's 1/gradient_accumulation_steps scaling,
            # so average over the actual micro-batch count yourself.
            averaged_loss = loss / num_micro_batches
            model_engine.backward(averaged_loss, scale_wrt_gas=False)   # accumulate only
        model_engine.step()                               # reduce + optimizer update

This is useful when ``backward`` and ``step`` must be decoupled and the number of
``backward()`` calls per optimizer step is decided by the caller at run time -- for example
client- or RPC-driven RL backends where a single optimizer step arrives as ``N`` ``backward()``
calls followed by one ``step()``, with ``N`` unknown at configuration time.

Unmanaged mode currently supports **ZeRO stage 0/1/2/3 and DDP**, including ZeRO optimizer-state
and parameter offload (CPU/NVMe). For ZeRO stage 0/1 (and DDP), ``backward()`` accumulates gradients
locally and ``step()`` performs the gradient all-reduce followed by the optimizer update. For ZeRO
stage 2/3, gradients are reduced/partitioned on every ``backward()`` (as in managed mode) and
``step()`` finalizes the accumulated partition gradients (including deferred offload norm/FP32 or
NVMe copy when offload is enabled) before the optimizer update; ZeRO ``overlap_comm`` is supported
in the stage-2 path.

.. note::
   By default ``backward()`` scales the loss and gradients by the configured
   ``gradient_accumulation_steps``. In unmanaged mode the number of ``backward()`` calls per step is
   owned by the caller and may differ from that value (and may vary per step), so the default scaling
   would be incorrect. Pass ``scale_wrt_gas=False`` to disable DeepSpeed's scaling and average the
   loss yourself over the actual micro-batch count, as shown above. (If you intentionally call
   ``backward()`` exactly ``gradient_accumulation_steps`` times per step, the default scaling still
   applies and no manual averaging is needed.)

.. note::
   Unmanaged mode supports ZeRO stage 0/1/2/3 (and DDP), including ZeRO optimizer-state and parameter
   offload (CPU/NVMe). It is incompatible with pipeline parallelism and DeepCompile, which are
   rejected at initialization. ZeRO ``overlap_comm`` is supported only with ZeRO stage 2
   (rejected for stage 0/1, where reduction is deferred to ``step()``).

.. autofunction:: deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.set_gradient_accumulation_boundary

Coalesced Gradient Reduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.coalesce_grad_reduction

Use this when one optimizer step needs multiple ``engine.backward()`` calls
and per-backward reduction is wasted work. Typical cases are GradCache-style
cached contrastive losses that replay backward over chunked representations,
and custom ``torch.autograd.Function`` subclasses that call
``torch.autograd.backward`` from inside their ``forward``. Results are
bit-exact against the per-backward baseline.

Under ZeRO-3, each backward inside the block leaves param-shaped gradients
on the leaf modules instead of triggering the per-backward reduce-scatter.
On exit, a single pass drives the reducer over the accumulated grads and
restores the partitioned ``averaged_gradients`` for ``step()``.

.. code-block:: python

    for batch in data_loader:
        chunks = batch.split(chunk_size)
        with model_engine.coalesce_grad_reduction():
            for chunk in chunks:
                loss = model_engine(chunk)
                model_engine.backward(loss)
        model_engine.step()

Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With ``N`` back-to-back ``backward()`` calls per step, ZeRO-2 and ZeRO-3
normally issue ``N`` gradient collectives (one per backward). Inside
``coalesce_grad_reduction()`` those collapse to one collective on exit.
ZeRO-1 already reduces only at the accumulation boundary, so its collective
count is unchanged; the context still removes the per-backward bucket setup
cost.

Memory
^^^^^^

Suppressing the per-backward reduction means each rank holds a full local
gradient copy for the duration of the ``with`` block.

* ZeRO-2: window-resident memory equals ZeRO-1 with
  :meth:`deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.no_sync`, one full gradient per rank
  held until flush. On a 2-GPU, 134M-param bf16 rig with ``N=4``, peak
  window memory drops from 640 MiB (baseline) to 384 MiB.
* ZeRO-3: window-resident is one full gradient per rank vs the
  ``1/world_size`` partition the per-backward path holds throughout. Peak
  is roughly equal to baseline (the in-flight backward already needs
  full-grad room and the accumulator reuses it).

Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^

* ZeRO stage 0 and pipeline parallelism raise ``NotImplementedError``.
* The BF16/FP16 optimizer wrappers (``BF16_Optimizer``, ``FP16_Optimizer``)
  route grads through their own ``backward_epilogue`` path and are not yet
  supported; the context raises ``NotImplementedError`` at entry. Use raw
  ZeRO-1/2/3 for now.
* ``engine.step()`` inside the ``with`` block raises.
* Cannot be nested inside :meth:`deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.no_sync`.
* Do not split one ``gradient_accumulation_steps`` window across multiple
  ``with`` blocks: the flush overwrites ``averaged_gradients`` on each exit.

:meth:`deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.no_sync` raises ``AssertionError`` for
ZeRO-2 and ZeRO-3 (``zero_optimization_partition_gradients()`` is true for
stage >= 2), so it cannot collapse collectives for those stages.
``coalesce_grad_reduction()`` is the equivalent for ZeRO-2/3.


Mixed Precision Training
-------------------------
DeepSpeed supports mixed precision training using either native or PyTorch mechanisms. The desired mixed precision mode can be selected through the configuration dict.
Mixed precision training can used with ZeRO (i.e., stages > 0) and without ZeRO (i.e., stage=0).


Native Mixed Precision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DeepSpeed provides native support for
`fp16 <https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/#fp16-training-options>`_ and `bf16 <https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/#bfloat16-training-options>`_ mixed precsion training.


PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DeepSpeed provides torch-compatible automatic mixed precision (AMP) training via
`torch.autocast <https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html>`_ functionality.  The following snippet illustrates how to enable Torch AMP.

    .. code-block:: python

        {
            "torch_autocast": {
                "enabled": true,
                "dtype": "bfloat16",
                "lower_precision_safe_modules": ["torch.nn.Linear", "torch.nn.Conv2d"]
            },
            ...
        }

Each configuration works as follows:

* ``enabled``: Enable ``torch.autocast`` when set to ``True``. You don't need to call ``torch.autocast`` in your code. The grad scaler is also applied in the DeepSpeed optimizer.
* ``dtype``: Lower precision dtype passed to ``torch.autocast``. Gradients for all-reduce (reduce-scatter) and parameters for all-gather (only for ZeRO3) of ``lower_precision_safe_modules`` are also downcasted to this ``dtype``.
* ``lower_precision_safe_modules``: The list of modules that will be downcasted for all-reduce (reduce-scatter) and all-gather (ZeRO3). The precision for PyTorch operators in forward/backward follows ``torch.autocast``'s policy, not this list. If you don't set this item, DeepSpeed uses the default list: ``[torch.nn.Linear, torch.nn.Conv1d, torch.nn.Conv2d, torch.nn.Conv3d]``.

Manual Backward with torch.autocast
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using ``torch.autocast`` with manual backward passes (``loss.backward()`` instead of ``engine.backward()``),
you must use ``engine.scale(loss)`` to apply the gradient scaler:

.. code-block:: python

    # Training loop with torch.autocast and manual backward
    for batch in data_loader:
        loss = model_engine(batch)

        # Apply loss scaling before manual backward
        scaled_loss = model_engine.scale(loss)
        scaled_loss.backward()

        model_engine.step()

The ``scale()`` method ensures that the ``torch.amp.GradScaler`` is properly applied when ``torch.autocast``
is enabled with fp16. For bf16 or when no mixed precision is used, ``scale()`` returns the loss unchanged.

If you call ``loss.backward()`` directly without using ``engine.scale()`` or ``engine.backward()``, DeepSpeed
will raise a ``RuntimeError`` to prevent training with unscaled gradients, which can lead to incorrect results
or gradient underflow.

Using torch.autocast Outside the Engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DeepSpeed applies ``torch.autocast`` internally during ``engine.forward()``.
However, you may also want autocast to cover code that runs **outside** the engine,
such as a loss function or post-processing logic. In that case, wrap the entire
forward-plus-loss block in your own ``torch.autocast`` context:

.. code-block:: python

    # Autocast covers both the engine forward AND the loss computation
    with torch.autocast(device_type="cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
        logits = model_engine(input_ids)
        loss = loss_fn(logits.view(-1, vocab_size), labels.view(-1))

Without the outer ``torch.autocast``, only the model's forward pass benefits from
autocast; the loss function would run in full precision.

When DeepSpeed detects a nested autocast context, it handles it as follows:

* If ``torch_autocast`` is **enabled** in the DeepSpeed config, the engine overrides the
  outer context with the dtype from the config. An info message is logged once.
* If ``torch_autocast`` is **disabled** in the config (i.e., you are using DeepSpeed's
  built-in bf16/fp16 support instead), the engine disables autocast inside
  ``engine.forward()`` and a warning is logged once.

In both cases, PyTorch's ``torch.autocast`` is idempotent when nested with the same
dtype, so there is no performance or correctness penalty from the nesting.

.. autofunction:: deepspeed.runtime.torch_autocast.init_autocast_params
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.runtime.torch_autocast.is_autocast_initialized
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.runtime.torch_autocast.get_default_autocast_lower_precision_modules
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.runtime.torch_autocast.has_autocast_dtype


Configuring ZeRO Leaf Modules
-----------------------------

ZeRO-3 relies on module execution order to gather partitioned parameters.
When models select submodules dynamically (for example, MoE routers), different data-parallel ranks may gather different sets of parameters, which can cause the all-gather collective to deadlock.
To avoid this problem, you can designate the parent of dynamically activated submodules (e.g., MoE experts) as a "leaf" module.
When a module is marked as a leaf, ZeRO gathers all of its descendants immediately and stops inserting hooks beneath it.

Programmatic API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use :func:`deepspeed.utils.set_z3_leaf_modules` to flag modules by class, class
name, or both. Optionally combine with
:func:`deepspeed.utils.set_z3_leaf_modules_by_name` to target specific entries
from ``model.named_modules()`` or
:func:`deepspeed.utils.set_z3_leaf_modules_by_suffix` to match suffixes of those
names.

.. code-block:: python

    from deepspeed.utils import (
        set_z3_leaf_modules,
        set_z3_leaf_modules_by_name,
        set_z3_leaf_modules_by_suffix,
    )

    # Match by class or subclass
    set_z3_leaf_modules(model, [CustomMoEBlock])

    # Match by fully qualified class name
    set_z3_leaf_modules(model, ["my_package.layers.CustomMoEBlock"])

    # Match by module name returned from model.named_modules()
    set_z3_leaf_modules_by_name(model, ["transformer.layers.0.experts"])

    # Match by suffix of names returned from model.named_modules()
    set_z3_leaf_modules_by_suffix(model, ["experts"])

Configuration in DeepSpeed config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same behavior can be controlled from the DeepSpeed config. Add a
``leaf_module`` block to ``zero_optimization`` specifying either classes,
module names, or name suffixes (or any combination). While the example below shows three different ways (``classes``, ``names``, and ``name_suffixes``) to specify modules as leaf modules, typically you will use just one of these.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu": 1,
      "zero_optimization": {
        "stage": 3,
        "leaf_module": {
          "classes": ["my_package.layers.CustomMoEBlock"],
          "names": ["transformer.layers.0.experts"],
          "name_suffixes": ["experts"]
        }
      }
    }

``names`` must match exactly what ``model.named_modules()`` produces. The
``name_suffixes`` field compares each suffix against the end of those same
module paths, making it convenient to apply a rule across repeated structures.
Entries in ``classes`` may be either bare class names (for example,
``MixtralSparseMoeBlock``) or fully qualified dotted paths; both forms are
accepted.

You can mix and match the API and configuration approaches; all referenced
modules are flagged before ZeRO installs its hooks.

By default DeepSpeed marks several Hugging Face MoE blocks—including Mixtral and Qwen MoE sparse blocks so that they behave well with ZeRO3. The default class list currently contains:

* ``transformers.models.mixtral.modeling_mixtral.MixtralSparseMoeBlock``
* ``transformers.models.qwen2_moe.modeling_qwen2_moe.Qwen2MoeSparseMoeBlock``
* ``transformers.models.qwen3_moe.modeling_qwen3_moe.Qwen3MoeSparseMoeBlock``


Model Saving
------------
.. autofunction:: deepspeed.DeepSpeedEngine.save_16bit_model


Additionally when a DeepSpeed checkpoint is created, a script ``zero_to_fp32.py`` is added there which can be used to reconstruct fp32 master weights into a single pytorch ``state_dict`` file.


Training Multiple Models
------------------------
DeepSpeed supports training multiple models, which is a useful feature in `scenarios <https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/usage_guides/deepspeed_multiple_model>`_ such as knowledge distillation and post-training RLHF.
The core approach is to create individual DeepSpeedEngines for each model.


Training Independent Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code snippet illustrates independently training multiple models on the same dataset.

.. code-block:: python

    model_engines = [engine for engine, _, _, _ in [deepspeed.initialize(m, ...,) for m in models]]
    for batch in data_loader:
       losses = [engine(batch) for engine in model_engines]
       for engine, loss in zip(model_engines, losses):
          engine.backward(loss)

The above is similar to typical DeepSpeed usage except for the creation of multiple DeepSpeedEngines (one for each model).


Jointly Training Models With Shared Loss
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code snippet illustrates jointly training multiple models on a shared loss value.

.. code-block:: python

    model_engines = [engine for engine, _, _, _ in [deepspeed.initialize(m, ...,) for m in models]]
    for batch in data_loader:
        losses = [engine(batch[0], batch[1]) for engine in model_engines]
        loss = sum(l / (i + 1) for i, l in enumerate(losses))
        loss.backward()

        for engine in model_engines:
            engine.step()

        for engine in model_engines:
            engine.optimizer.zero_grad()

Besides the use of multiple DeepSpeedEngines, the above differs from typical usage in two key ways:

#. The **backward** call is made using the common loss value rather on individual model engines.

You can call ``loss.backward()`` once for the shared loss.

**Note:** Previously, you had to call ``_backward_epilogue`` on each model engine after ``loss.backward()``. However, starting from v0.18.3, DeepSpeed automatically handles this internally, so you no longer need to call ``_backward_epilogue`` manually.


Automatic Tensor Parallel Training
----------------------------------
DeepSpeed supports **Automatic Tensor Parallel (AutoTP) training** for sharding
model weights across GPUs while remaining compatible with ZeRO and standard
training workflows. This training API is different from the inference-only
tensor parallel API exposed by ``deepspeed.init_inference``.

Tensor parallelism (TP) splits the computations and parameters of large layers
across multiple GPUs so each rank holds only a shard of the weight matrix. This
is an efficient way to train large-scale transformer models by reducing per-GPU
memory pressure while keeping the layer math distributed across the TP group.

AutoTP training is enabled by setting ``tensor_parallel`` in the DeepSpeed
config and passing it to ``deepspeed.initialize``. DeepSpeed applies AutoTP
sharding during engine initialization; calling ``deepspeed.tp_model_init``, which we previously used to initialize AutoTP, is now optional.
See :ref:`autotp-training-init-details` for more details.

.. code-block:: python

    import deepspeed

    ds_config = {
        "train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu": 1,
        "zero_optimization": {"stage": 2},
        "tensor_parallel": {"autotp_size": 4},
    }

    engine, optimizer, _, _ = deepspeed.initialize(
        model=model,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        config=ds_config,
        mpu=mpu,  # optional: TP/DP process groups
    )

.. note::
   AutoTP training supports ZeRO stages 0, 1, 2, and 3. With ZeRO Stage 3, checkpoint
   save/load and universal checkpoint conversion gather weights across both the ZeRO
   data-parallel and the tensor-parallel dimensions, so saved/converted checkpoints are
   complete.

.. _autotp-training-init-details:

Initialization behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AutoTP previously required calling ``set_autotp_mode(training=True)`` and ``deepspeed.tp_model_init`` before ``deepspeed.initialize``. Now we can include all the necessary configurations in the DeepSpeed config.
We still support the traditional initialization path for backward compatibility.
When you use both (i.e. calling ``set_autotp_mode(training=True)`` and ``deepspeed.tp_model_init`` and passing the config to ``deepspeed.initialize``), we will merge the settings at initialization. When we have conflicting settings, we will error out.

Parameter partitioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TP sharding needs to know which parameter tensors should be partitioned and
along which dimensions. AutoTP provides three ways to balance ready-to-use
defaults with customizability:

* **Heuristics**: automatic sharding based on parameter names and model rules.
* **Preset**: choose a built-in model family via ``preset_model``.
* **Custom specs**: define regex patterns and partition rules via ``partition_config``.
* **HuggingFace tp_plan**: automatically detected from ``model.config.base_model_tp_plan`` or ``model._tp_plan``.

HuggingFace tp_plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Many HuggingFace models (e.g. Llama, Qwen, Gemma2) define a
``base_model_tp_plan`` in their model config. When present, DeepSpeed
automatically extracts and converts this plan into internal partition rules.
This means you do not need ``preset_model`` or ``partition_config`` for these
models -- just set ``autotp_size``.

The resolution priority is:

1. ``partition_config`` (user-defined custom specs -- highest priority)
2. HuggingFace ``tp_plan`` (from model config)
3. AutoTP heuristics / ``preset_model`` (lowest priority)

Currently ``colwise``, ``rowwise``, and gathered column styles
(``colwise_gather_output`` / ``colwise_rep``) from the HuggingFace ``tp_plan``
are supported. Gathered column output layers may have output dimensions that are
not divisible by ``autotp_size``; DeepSpeed uses uneven local shards and gathers
back to the original logical output size. Other types (``local_colwise``,
``local_rowwise``, ``local_packed_rowwise``, ``gather``,
``sequence_parallel``) are not yet handled and will raise an error.

Heuristic rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Heuristics use parameter names and model-specific rules to decide how to shard
layers. If you are training a supported model (see
:ref:`autotp-supported-models`), the heuristic rules automatically shard the
model, so you only need to add ``autotp_size``.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      ...
      "tensor_parallel": {
        "autotp_size": 4
      },
      "zero_optimization": {
        ...
      },
      ...
    }

Preset-based partitioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can explicitly specify the model family with ``preset_model``:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "tensor_parallel": {
        "autotp_size": 4,
        "preset_model": "llama"
      }
    }

See :ref:`autotp-supported-models` for the supported preset names and the
implementation in `AutoTPPresets <https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/deepspeed/module_inject/autotp_config.py>`_.
If you add a new model family, you can easily add a new preset by defining
patterns like the existing presets, and we welcome PRs for those additions.

Custom layer specs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are training a custom model, you can use ``partition_config`` to specify
custom regex-based patterns and partition settings.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "tensor_parallel": {
        "autotp_size": 4,
        "partition_config": {
          "use_default_specs": false,
          "layer_specs": [
            {
              "patterns": [".*\\.o_proj\\.weight$", ".*\\.down_proj\\.weight$"],
              "partition_type": "row"
            },
            {
              "patterns": [".*\\.[qkv]_proj\\.weight$"],
              "partition_type": "column"
            },
            {
              "patterns": [".*\\.gate_up_proj\\.weight$"],
              "partition_type": "column",
              "shape": [2, -1],
              "partition_dim": 0
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }

You can also set ``use_default_specs`` to ``true`` to merge your custom
patterns on top of the preset (when ``preset_model`` is provided).

For fused or packed weights (for example QKV or gate/up projections), the
``shape`` and ``partition_dim`` options control sub-parameter partitioning.
Sub-parameter partitioning lets AutoTP split a single weight tensor into
logical chunks before applying tensor-parallel sharding. For example, the
``gate_up_proj`` weight can be viewed as two packed matrices (gate and up) by
setting ``shape`` to ``[2, -1]`` and ``partition_dim`` to ``0``; AutoTP then
partitions each chunk consistently across tensor-parallel ranks.

Another example is GQA-style fused QKV weights. The tensor can contain unequal
Q/K/V segments stacked along the output dimension. For example, set ``shape``
to the explicit sizes (for example ``[(q_size, kv_size, kv_size), -1]``) and
``partition_dim`` to ``0`` so AutoTP splits the Q, K, and V regions first, then
shards each region across tensor-parallel ranks.

    {
      "patterns": [".*\\.qkv_proj\\.weight$"],
      "partition_type": "column",
      "shape": [[q_size, kv_size, kv_size], -1],
      "partition_dim": 0
    }

Model-type filtering for shared configs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use ``model_types`` when you want a single config to work across multiple model
families but apply different specs. This is useful in shared training scripts
or when patterns overlap across architectures.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "tensor_parallel": {
        "autotp_size": 4,
        "partition_config": {
          "layer_specs": [
            {
              "patterns": [".*\\.qkv_proj\\.weight$"],
              "partition_type": "column",
              "shape": [[q_size, kv_size, kv_size], -1],
              "partition_dim": 0,
              "model_types": ["llama"]
            },
            {
              "patterns": [".*\\.qkv_proj\\.weight$"],
              "partition_type": "column",
              "shape": [3, -1],
              "partition_dim": 0,
              "model_types": ["qwen2"]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }


.. _autotp-supported-models:

Supported models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following model families are supported by built-in AutoTP presets:

- ``llama``
- ``bloom``
- ``chatglm``
- ``mixtral``
- ``deepseek_v2``
- ``qwen2``
- ``phi3``

Preset definitions live in `AutoTPPresets <https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/deepspeed/module_inject/autotp_config.py>`_.
If you add a new model family, you can easily add a new preset by defining
patterns like the existing presets, and we welcome PRs for those additions.

These strings are the values accepted by ``preset_model`` and are matched
against the model type in ``model.config.model_type`` (case-insensitive). When
``preset_model`` is not set, AutoTP uses the legacy automatic sharding rules
unless you provide a custom ``partition_config``.
These presets are also useful when you want to extend the default patterns:
set ``use_default_specs`` to ``true`` in ``partition_config`` to merge your custom
specs on top of the selected preset.


Automatic Sequence Parallel Training
------------------------------------
DeepSpeed supports **Automatic Sequence Parallel (AutoSP) training** for enabling
compiler-based sequence parallelism to unlock long-context LLM training. AutoSP
leverages defines custom passes to automatically shard inputs along the
sequence dimension and enable Ulysses-styled sequence parallelism.

AutoSP training is enabled by setting ``compile`` and ``passes`` in the DeepSpeed
config and calling ``prepare_autosp_inputs()`` to prepare inputs before each forward pass.

.. code-block:: python

    import deepspeed
    from deepspeed.compile.passes.sp_compile import prepare_autosp_inputs

    ds_config = {
        "train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu": 1,
        "zero_optimization": {"stage": 0},
        "compile": {
            "deepcompile": True,
            "passes": ["autosp"],
        }
    }

    engine, optimizer, _, _ = deepspeed.initialize(
        model=model,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        config=ds_config,
    )

    # Compile the model before training
    engine.compile(backend='inductor')

    for batch in dataloader:
        input_ids = prepare_autosp_inputs(
            input_id=batch["input_ids"],
            label_id=batch["labels"],
            position_id=batch.get("position_ids"),
            seq_dim=1
        )
        loss = engine(input_ids)
        engine.backward(loss)
        engine.step()

.. note::
   AutoSP requires ZeRO stage 0 (no ZeRO optimization). Using AutoSP with ZeRO stages 1, 2, or 3 is not currently supported.
   AutoSP also requires ``torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention()`` as the attention backend.
   The sequence length and the number of query, key, and value heads of every SDPA call must be divisible by
   ``sequence_parallel_size``.

Input Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before each forward pass, inputs must be prepared using ``prepare_autosp_inputs()`` to
mark the sequence dimension as dynamic and annotate tensors for identification during
automatic sharding:

.. code-block:: python

    from deepspeed.compile.passes.sp_compile import prepare_autosp_inputs

    input_ids = prepare_autosp_inputs(
        input_id=input_ids,
        label_id=labels,
        position_id=position_ids,  # optional
        attention_mask=attention_mask,  # optional
        seq_dim=1
    )

This serves as a hint to the compiler to know which inputs should be sharded across which dimension.

Memory Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AutoSP includes selective activation checkpointing that recomputes matmul operations
during backpropagation while preserving attention activations. This is effective for
long-context training because attention operations scale quadratically with sequence
length and dominate computation latency, while matmul operations scale linearly and are relatively cheaper
to recompute. This provides significant memory savings with minimal computational
overhead

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

AutoSP currently supports only ``torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention``. Other attention patterns require additional pattern matching logic.

AutoSP requires a fully connected computation graph without breaks. Graph breaks destroy the use-def chains across graphs and the compiler cannot propoaget sequence dimension sharding information.
